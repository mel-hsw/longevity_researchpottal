Specifically: \n\n- Exercise activates AMPK. (mol_bio_rep_2025, mol_bio_rep_2025__abstract__000) \n\n- Activated AMPK stimulates SIRT1 by increasing the NAD+/NADH ratio, thereby promoting SIRT1 activity. (mol_bio_rep_2025, mol_bio_rep_2025__abstract__001) \n\n- SIRT1 deacetylates and thereby enhances PGC-1\u03b1 activity. (mol_bio_rep_2025, mol_bio_rep_2025__abstract__003) \n\n- PGC-1\u03b1 drives mitochondrial biogenesis via coactivation of transcription factors such as NRF1 and TFAM and improves oxidative metabolism; exercise-induced PGC-1\u03b1 activation also enhances mitophagy and reduces excessive ROS. (mol_bio_rep_2025, mol_bio_rep_2025__abstract__003) \n\n- Exercise increases PGC-1\u03b1 transcription in muscle (via p38 MAPK) and mitochondrial-localized AMPK responds to local energetics and contributes to exercise-induced mitophagy. (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__024) \n\n- AMPK phosphorylates Ulk1, which is required for targeting mitochondria to lysosomes in exercise-induced mitophagy, and exercise can reestablish autophagic flux and mitochondrial quality control. (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__035; cells_2022, cells_2022__body__025) \n\n- AMPK and SIRT1 activated by exercise inhibit NF-\u03baB (by deacetylating p65), reducing transcription of SASP-associated proinflammatory cytokines. (mol_bio_rep_2025, mol_bio_rep_2025__abstract__006) \n\n- Empirical support: a short-term swimming protocol in aged mice increased hippocampal SIRT1 and PGC-1\u03b1 levels along with survival/proliferation\u2013related proteins.

Key criteria are:\n\n- Age-sensitivity and mortality prediction: a biomarker should (1) correlate with multiple age-sensitive features after adjusting for chronological age and (2) be a good predictor of all-cause mortality (age deviation/AgeDev). (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__001)\n\n- Response criteria: the biomarker should be responsive to both accelerated and decelerated aging and to interventions (i.e., show change with geroprotective or pro\u2011aging exposures). (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__003) (cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__003)\n\n- Mechanistic criteria: a valid biomarker should reflect underlying cellular and molecular processes (hallmarks/pillars) of aging, linking the measure to biology rather than only to chronological age. (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__002)\n\n- Generalizability: biomarkers should function across tissues, species, and human populations (e.g., sexes, ethnicities, countries), or at least the limits to generalizability should be characterized. (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__002) (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__003)\n\n- Predictive/prognostic and clinical validation: biomarkers intended for clinical use should be analytically and clinically validated, show association with relevant clinical endpoints, and\u2014if proposed as surrogate endpoints\u2014predict meaningful clinical benefit. Validation across multiple human cohorts is emphasized. (cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__001) (cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__003)\n\n- Integrative/multisystem robustness: composite, multisystem biomarkers are favored because they condense signal across systems, reduce noise, and better correlate with other aging features than single measures.

(cell_2023, cell_2023__results__001) (cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__002)\n\n- Practical considerations (sample choice and cost): suitable sample type and assay cost/throughput matter\u2014for example, blood-based measures may reflect hematopoietic changes preferentially, and measurement costs affect large-scale applicability.

Eight weeks of swimming increased autophagic flux in mouse skeletal muscle, and exercise-induced increases in mitochondrial biogenesis markers (PGC-1\u03b1, SDH, COX IV and CS activity) occurred only when autophagy was active; short-term pharmacological inhibition of autophagy (colchicine) abolished those biogenesis responses (ju_2016, ju_2016__abstract__000; ju_2016, ju_2016__results__002). The authors conclude that mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis are tightly coupled and that a coordinated balance between degradation and synthesis is a prerequisite for mitochondrial adaptation to endurance exercise (ju_2016, ju_2016__results__003). Supporting evidence from autophagy-deficient transgenic mice (Atg5/Atg7/Atg6 models) shows attenuated exercise-induced metabolic benefits and decreased mitochondrial function and exercise performance, consistent with a necessary role for basal autophagy in enabling mitochondrial adaptation to exercise (ju_2016, ju_2016__introduction__001; ju_2016, ju_2016__results__003). Mechanistic notes reported in these chunks include that Bnip3 protein was increased with exercise (and further with colchicine) while PINK1/Parkin protein levels were unchanged in this exercise model, suggesting receptor-mediated mitophagy involvement rather than PINK1/Parkin activation in this setting (ju_2016, ju_2016__results__002; ju_2016, ju_2016__results__001).

Key criteria described in the review are:\n\n- Age-sensitivity: the biomarker should (1) correlate with multiple age-sensitive features after adjusting for chronological age and (2) be a good predictor of all-cause mortality (i.e., relate to AgeDev and aging outcomes) (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__001). \n\n- Mechanistic relevance: a valid biomarker should reflect underlying cellular and molecular processes of aging (mechanistic criteria) (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__002). \n\n- Generalizability: biomarkers should function across applications (tissues, species, human populations), or at least their limits of generalizability should be understood (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__002). \n\n- Responsiveness (response criteria): a biomarker should be responsive to both accelerated and decelerated aging and indicate biological reactions to exposures or interventions (i.e., act as a response biomarker) (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__003) (cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__003). \n\n- Clinical validation / surrogate-endpoint evidence: clinical validation should establish that the biomarker identifies outcomes of interest and that changes in the biomarker predict meaningful clinical benefit when intended as a surrogate endpoint (cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__001). \n\n- Integrative / multisystem performance: composite multisystem (integrative) biomarkers tend to be more robust and show stronger correlation with other aging features than single biomarkers (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__001). \n\n- Distinction between progress versus pace: the review distinguishes biomarkers that estimate the progress of aging (biological age/AgeDev) from those that measure the rate or pace of aging, noting both types are useful and complementary (cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__002). \n\n- Practical/technical considerations: the biological sample chosen matters (e.g., blood may primarily reflect hematopoietic changes; cell-type-specific aging may occur), temporal dynamics/noise must be considered, and measurement cost must be relatively low for large-scale use (cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__002) (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__004).", "citations": [{"source_id": "cell_2023", "chunk_id": "cell_2023__results__001", "relevant_quote": "Validity criteria may be further expanded into two related criteria: a biomarker of aging should (1) correlate with multiple age-sensitive features after adjusting for chronological age and (2) be a good predictor of all-cause mortality."}, {"source_id": "cell_2023", "chunk_id": "cell_2023__results__002", "relevant_quote": "Mechanistic criteria relate to the underlying biology of aging."}, {"source_id": "cell_2023", "chunk_id": "cell_2023__results__002", "relevant_quote": "Generalizability broadly refers to the ability of biomarkers to function across different applications."}, {"source_id": "cell_2023", "chunk_id": "cell_2023__results__003", "relevant_quote": "Response criteria Generally, response criteria posit that a biomarker of aging should be responsive to both accelerated and decelerated aging."}, {"source_id": "cell_2023", "chunk_id": "cell_2023__methods__003", "relevant_quote": "A response biomarker indicates the biological reaction of an individual to an exposure or intervention."}, {"source_id": "cell_2023", "chunk_id": "cell_2023__methods__001", "relevant_quote": "Clinical validation seeks to establish whether a biomarker can indeed identify the outcome of interest and determine how useful it is for clinical decision making."}, {"source_id": "cell_2023", "chunk_id": "cell_2023__results__001", "relevant_quote": "composite multisystem biomarkers are more robust and show a stronger correlation with other features of aging than single biomarkers of aging."}, {"source_id": "cell_2023", "chunk_id": "cell_2023__methods__002", "relevant_quote": "An important conceptual distinction needs to be made between biomarkers of biological age and biomarkers of the rate of aging."}, {"source_id": "cell_2023", "chunk_id": "cell_2023__methods__002", "relevant_quote": "the biological sample used for measuring aging is critical."}, {"source_id": "cell_2023", "chunk_id": "cell_2023__results__004", "relevant_quote": "the cost of measurement must be relatively low."}], "confidence": "high", "evidence_quality": "multiple explicit, consistent statements across methods and results sections of the review", "no_evidence": false, "caveats": []}}

Mechanisms supported in the context include: (1) maintenance and improvement of mitochondrial quantity and quality (biogenesis, respiratory chain content, supercomplex formation), which supports energetic capacity (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__007; s2468867319_2019, s2468867319_2019__introduction__003; s2468867319_2019, s2468867319_2019__introduction__001). (2) Enhancement of proteostatic mechanisms, notably mitophagy/mitochondrial protein turnover, which has been linked to muscle hypertrophy in aged mice and is promoted by endurance exercise (s2468867319_2019, s2468867319_2019__introduction__003; s2468867319_2019, s2468867319_2019__introduction__004). (3) Preservation or improvement of neuromuscular function and motor units/neuromuscular junctions, which helps maintain muscle mass and force (s2468867319_2019, s2468867319_2019__introduction__001). (4) Remodeling of muscle (fiber-type shifts toward more oxidative IIa fibers) and increased angiogenesis mediated in part by PGC-1\u03b1, improving oxygen/nutrient delivery and supporting muscle endurance and function (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__007). (5) Metabolic improvements including reduced intermuscular lipids and improved insulin sensitivity (GLUT4 translocation via AMPK signaling), which support muscle energetic homeostasis (s2468867319_2019, s2468867319_2019__introduction__000; cells_2022, cells_2022__body__004). (6) Modulation of muscle growth versus breakdown pathways \u2014 endurance exercise lowers myostatin, is associated with anabolic Akt\u2013mTOR signaling, and reduces proteolytic ubiquitin ligases (MuRF-1, Atrogin-1) \u2014 all of which favor preservation of muscle mass (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__006). Together these adaptations are proposed to explain why lifelong aerobic athletes show preserved muscle mass and function with age (s2468867319_2019, s2468867319_2019__introduction__000; s2468867319_2019, s2468867319_2019__conclusion__000).\n\nImportant nuances and limitations reported in the context: some markers of proteostasis change differently after short-term initiation of training versus in long-term trained older individuals, and some studies found lower cumulative protein synthesis in older versus younger athletes (s2468867319_2019, s2468867319_2019__introduction__004). The effects also vary by muscle group and by age/timepoint of assessment (s2468867319_2019, s2468867319_2019__introduction__004; s2468867319_2019, s2468867319_2019__introduction__005).

Examples from intervention studies include:\n\n- DNA methylation (DNAm)\n  - Changes in leukocyte TNF and IL6 DNAm after 8 weeks of eccentric resistance-training exercise (linked with TNF expression) (nutrients_2023a, nutrients_2023a__body__006). \n  - Decreased ADRB3 DNAm after 8 weeks of folate plus hazelnut oil supplementation (nutrients_2023a, nutrients_2023a__body__006). \n  - LINE-1 methylation associations with metabolic outcomes after dietary interventions (e.g., baseline LINE-1 methylation associated with triglyceride changes) (nutrients_2023a, nutrients_2023a__body__004). \n  - Exercise (high-intensity interval walking and moderate exercise) attenuating age-dependent reduction in ASC methylation (nutrients_2023a, nutrients_2023a__body__006). \n  - Higher physical activity associated with IL-10 hypomethylation and TNF hypermethylation (nutrients_2023a, nutrients_2023a__body__006). \n  - Higher regional DNAm at LINC00319 associated with greater reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressures after a 2-year low-fat diet (nutrients_2023a, nutrients_2023a__body__005). \n  - Higher regional DNAm at CPT1A linked to greater reductions in total plasma triglycerides on a low-fat diet (nutrients_2023a, nutrients_2023a__body__003). \n  - Baseline BMAL1 methylation negatively correlated with serum lipid responses to a 4-month Mediterranean dietary intervention (nutrients_2023a, nutrients_2023a__body__003). \n  - Methylation of the insulin gene related to LDL-c changes after inulin agave intervention in patients with type 2 diabetes (nutrients_2023a, nutrients_2023a__body__003). \n  - Interaction between DNAm at TXNIP and dietary protein intake influencing insulin and HOMA-IR changes in the POUNDS Lost trial (nutrients_2023a, nutrients_2023a__body__001). \n  - LINE-1 and LUMA methylation changes associated with blood glucose changes in breast cancer survivors after lifestyle modification (nutrients_2023a, nutrients_2023a__body__001). \n\n- Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs)\n  - Serum miR-128-3p variations negatively correlated with changes in MCP-1 after a lifestyle program (nutrients_2023a, nutrients_2023a__body__006). \n  - miR-10a-5p and miR-211-5p expression changed (downregulated in poor responders, upregulated in successful inflammatory responses) after a 12-week diet plus strength-training program in women with metastatic breast cancer (nutrients_2023a, nutrients_2023a__body__006). \n  - Plasma miR-130b and miR-221 concentrations changed in parallel with CRP after an 8-week diet enriched with almonds and walnuts (nutrients_2023a, nutrients_2023a__body__006). \n  - Increases in serum miR-15 and miR-21 inversely associated with IL-6 expression in lymphocytes after a 4-month pistachio-supplemented diet in subjects with prediabetes (nutrients_2023a, nutrients_2023a__body__007). \n  - Decreases in serum miR-99b associated with lower fasting glucose and higher HOMA-\u03b2 after an 18-month hypocaloric diet plus physical activity intervention (nutrients_2023a, nutrients_2023a__body__002). \n  - Plasma miR-374a-5p negatively correlated with fasting insulin and HOMA-IR changes after a 4-month lifestyle intervention (nutrients_2023a, nutrients_2023a__body__002). \n  - Circulating miR-221-3p inversely correlated with an insulin sensitivity index after an 8-week multidisciplinary program (nutrients_2023a, nutrients_2023a__body__002). \n  - miR-128-1-5p levels interacted with physical activity to influence HOMA-IR changes during hypocaloric diet interventions (nutrients_2023a, nutrients_2023a__body__002). \n  - Interventions combining a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant (MitoQuinol) and endurance training were associated with changes in miR-126 (proposed mechanism) and reductions in miR-21 and miR-222 alongside reduced IL-6 and increased antioxidant capacity (nutrients_2023a, nutrients_2023a__body__005;

Their main difference is emphasis: Furrer & Handschin elevate physiological/functional biomarkers (e.g., cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle measures) as established, actionable benchmarks, whereas Cell 2023 (Moqri et al.) presents a broad, regulatory-oriented framework focused on defining terms, classes of biomarkers, and cautions around data-driven molecular clocks.\n\nWhere they agree (each statement is supported below):\n- Need for a formal framework and shared terminology: Cell 2023 states they \"propose a framework for classifying and assessing biomarkers of aging\" (cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__000). Furrer & Handschin similarly position physiological biomarkers into a proposed framework adapted from previous criteria (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__009). (Both sources cited below.)\n\n- Mechanistic validation / biological plausibility is important: Cell 2023 says \"A valid biomarker of aging should reflect these underlying cellular and molecular processes\" (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__002). Furrer & Handschin list \u2018\u2018biological validation\u2019\u2019 (biomarkers from pathways that actively drive aging) among essential validation types (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__008).\n\n- Generalizability and cross-species / cross-tissue issues matter: Cell 2023 discusses \"Generalizability\" as a criterion and the value of biomarkers that function across cells, tissues, species, or populations (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__002). Furrer & Handschin emphasize cross-species and broad applicability in their assessment criteria (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__009).\n\n- Composite / multisystem biomarkers are more robust than single-feature clocks: Cell 2023 states that \"composite multisystem biomarkers are more robust and show a stronger correlation with other features of aging than single biomarkers of aging\" (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__001). Furrer & Handschin likewise argue for compound/multiorgan measures and integration (multi-omics and physiological benchmarks) as most likely to monitor aging progression (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__008).\n\n- Caution about molecular/data-driven clocks and need for longitudinal validation: Cell 2023 warns that data-driven models may mix causal features with uninstructive correlates and recommends caution (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__001). Furrer & Handschin describe substantial technical, tissue, and contextual limitations of molecular clocks and conclude they \"will have to be used with caution, awaiting validation in longitudinal human studies in large cohorts\" (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__007; furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__008).\n\nWhere they differ (emphasis / positioning):\n- Emphasis on physiological biomarkers as \"ready for prime time\": Furrer & Handschin explicitly title a section \"PHYSIOLOGICAL BIOMARKERS OF AGING: READY FOR PRIME TIME!\" and argue physiological/functional measures (cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle mass/strength, frailty measures) are well-established predictors of morbidity and mortality and should be used as benchmarks (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__009; furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__010). Cell 2023 does not make the same categorical claim; rather, it focuses on building a consensus framework, definitions (e.g., AgeDev), and evaluating biomarkers (cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__000; cell_2023, cell_2023__results__001).\n\n- Regulatory and terminological focus vs practical benchmarking emphasis: Moqri et al. (Cell 2023) emphasize consensus terminology (AgeDev), classification, and the role of biomarkers for regulatory/surrogate endpoint use and trial design (cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__000; cell_2023, cell_2023__conclusion__000). Furrer & Handschin put stronger practical emphasis on physiological measures as indispensable endpoints in trials and as benchmarks against which molecular clocks should be judged (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__009).\n\n- Tone about molecular clocks\u2019 maturity: Furrer & Handschin provide detailed critiques of current molecular clocks (technical variability, tissue-specific differences, circadian effects, poor overlap between clocks) and conclude limited current readiness (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__007; furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__006). Cell 2023 acknowledges limitations of data-driven approaches and calls for mechanistic and longitudinal validation, while also describing ongoing efforts to build more biologically informed clocks (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__001; cell_2023, cell_2023__results__002).\n\nConflicts or tensions to note\n- Furrer & Handschin\u2019s position that physiological biomarkers are \"ready for prime time\" and should serve as benchmarks is a stronger normative claim than the Cell 2023 framework, which focuses on creating standards, terminology, and evaluation pathways without singling out physiological measures to the same extent (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__009; cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__000). Both call for caution with molecular clocks, but Furrer & Handschin emphasize using direct functional measures where possible (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__009; furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__010).\n\nBottom line\nBoth works share core principles for validating aging biomarkers (mechanistic plausibility, generalizability, age-sensitivity, analytical and clinical validation, and preference for multisystem/composite measures). Furrer & Handschin argue more strongly that physiological/functional biomarkers currently meet these criteria and should be used as benchmarks, while Moqri et al. (Cell 2023) provide a broad consensus framework, definitions, and a regulatory-oriented pathway for assessing both molecular and functional biomarkers.\n", "citations": [{"source_id": "cell_2023", "chunk_id": "cell_2023__methods__000", "relevant_quote": "we formed the Biomarkers of Aging Con- sortium (https://www.agingconsortium.org) to engage a multi- disciplinary panel ... we propose a framework for classifying and assessing biomarkers of aging"}, {"source_id": "cell_2023", "chunk_id": "cell_2023__results__002", "relevant_quote": "A valid biomarker of aging should reflect these underlying cellular and molecular processes."}, {"source_id": "cell_2023", "chunk_id": "cell_2023__results__002", "relevant_quote": "Generalizability broadly refers to the ability of biomarkers to function across different applications."}, {"source_id": "cell_2023", "chunk_id": "cell_2023__results__001", "relevant_quote": "composite multisystem biomarkers are more robust and show a stronger correlation with other features of aging than single biomarkers of aging."}, {"source_id": "cell_2023", "chunk_id": "cell_2023__results__001", "relevant_quote": "a biomarker of aging should (1) correlate with multiple age-sen- sitive features after adjusting for chronological age and (2) be a good predictor of all-cause mortality."}, {"source_id": "furrer_handschin_2025", "chunk_id": "furrer_handschin_2025__results__008", "relevant_quote": "First, biomarkers are especially valuable when they originate from pathways that actively drive aging (biological validation)"}, {"source_id": "furrer_handschin_2025", "chunk_id": "furrer_handschin_2025__results__009", "relevant_quote": "6.

Time\u2011restricted feeding in flies and mice produced substantial physiological benefits (neural, cardiovascular, metabolic) and mitigated diet\u2011induced metabolic disease without lowering caloric intake. Human clinical evidence is described as showing short\u2011term improvements in body composition and cardiovascular markers, with some longer\u2011term metabolic benefits reported, but heterogeneity in study designs limits generalizability. (f1000_2016, f1000_2016__introduction__002) (f1000_2016, f1000_2016__introduction__003) (nutrients_2024, nutrients_2024__results__001) (nutrients_2024, nutrients_2024__results__002)\n\nFasting\u2011mimicking diets (FMDs)\n- Mechanisms: FMDs are very low\u2011calorie, low\u2011protein regimens that elicit fasting\u2011like physiology \u2014 reduced glucose and IGF\u20111 and increased ketone bodies \u2014 thereby engaging similar downstream pathways to fasting/CR. (f1000_2016, f1000_2016__introduction__003)\n- Evidence: FMDs produced fasting\u2011like physiological responses and favorable healthspan effects in preclinical work (examples cited include enhanced healthspan, hematopoietic system rejuvenation, and promoted adult neurogenesis). The context frames FMD as a strategy to recapitulate beneficial fasting biology without complete food deprivation, but long\u2011term human longevity evidence is not presented in the provided material. (f1000_2016, f1000_2016__introduction__003)\n\nShared themes and important caveats\n- Shared mechanisms: All three approaches converge on nutrient\u2011sensing pathways (mTOR, AMPK, IIS/sirtuins) and promote stress\u2011resistance and autophagy in ways that are plausibly linked to longevity in model organisms. (f1000_2016, f1000_2016__introduction__000) (nutrients_2024, nutrients_2024__results__000) (nutrients_2024, nutrients_2024__results__001)\n- Heterogeneity and limits of translation: Responses vary by species, strain/genetic background, and sex; dietary composition, baseline intake, extent and timing of restriction, age of initiation, and adherence are all unresolved variables. Potential adverse effects (loss of lean mass, immune compromise, bone loss, cognitive or mood impacts) have been reported in some contexts. Human evidence for definitive longevity extension is lacking or mixed, so applicability to human lifespan requires further study. (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__014) (nutrients_2024, nutrients_2024__results__002)\n\nBottom line: In model organisms CR, IF, and FMD engage overlapping nutrient\u2011sensing and stress\u2011response mechanisms that are plausibly pro\u2011longevity; CR has the strongest and most reproducible lifespan effects in models, IF and FMD can capture many of the same pathways (sometimes without net calorie loss), and all show promising healthspan effects. However, human longevity evidence is mixed or not yet definitive, and translational uncertainties and potential adverse effects merit caution.\n", "citations": [{"source_id": "f1000_2016", "chunk_id": "f1000_2016__abstract__000", "relevant_quote": "Caloric restriction is the most effective and reproducible dietary intervention known to regulate aging and increase the healthy lifespan in various model organisms"}, {"source_id": "f1000_2016", "chunk_id": "f1000_2016__introduction__000", "relevant_quote": "we use caloric restriction (CR) to refer to a dietary intervention with an overall 20\u201340% reduction of total caloric intake"}, {"source_id": "f1000_2016", "chunk_id": "f1000_2016__introduction__000", "relevant_quote": "effects on aging are not simply the result of the reduced amount of calories consumed... down-regulation of insulin and insulin-like signalling (IIS), as well as of the amino signalling target of rapamycin (TOR)-S6 kinase pathway, and the glucose signalling Ras-protein kinase A (PKA) pathway"}, {"source_id": "nutrients_2024", "chunk_id": "nutrients_2024__results__001", "relevant_quote": "CR also activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) due to lower ATP levels, which then inhibits mTORC1... promotes autophagy"}, {"source_id": "f1000_2016", "chunk_id": "f1000_2016__introduction__002", "relevant_quote": "Intermittent fasting refers to practicing this intervention every other day whereas periodic fasting refers to severe restriction for two or more days periodically...

Nat. Commun. 2017, 8, 548. [CrossR"}]}, "response": {"answer": "Across the provided corpus, exercise-associated effects on mitochondria converge on a consistent set of molecular pathways and cellular processes: (1) AMPK activation as a central energy-sensor that links exercise to mitochondrial adaptation, (2) induction of mitochondrial biogenesis through PGC-1\u03b1, (3) activation of mitophagy/autophagy and mitochondrial quality-control mechanisms (including Ulk1 and Parkin-related pathways), (4) regulation of mitochondrial dynamics (fission/fusion, with Drp1 involvement), (5) upregulation of antioxidant defenses and reductions in oxidative damage, and (6) downstream effects on mitochondrial enzyme content, respiration, and insulin sensitivity. These themes are repeated across cardiac and skeletal muscle studies and across acute and training contexts in the corpus.\n\nKey links in the corpus\n- AMPK signaling: Multiple studies describe exercise-associated AMPK activation and link AMPK to mitophagy, mitochondrial enzyme induction, and graded activation during exercise (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__036) (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__023). (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__036) (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__023)\n\n- PGC-1\u03b1\u2013driven biogenesis: PGC-1\u03b1 is repeatedly cited as a nodal regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and as being transcriptionally induced by exercise signaling (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__024) (mol_bio_rep_2025, mol_bio_rep_2025__abstract__010).\n\n- Mitophagy / autophagy and mitochondrial quality control: Exercise is linked to reestablishing autophagic flux and mitochondrial quality control in pathological contexts, and AMPK phosphorylation of Ulk1 is identified as required for targeting mitochondria to lysosomes in exercise-induced mitophagy. Parkin-mediated mitophagy is also reported in exercise-induced cardioprotection (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__025) (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__036) (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__026).\n\n- Mitochondrial dynamics (fission/fusion): The corpus reports distinct patterns of fusion, fission, and mitophagy with exercise training and cites AMPK-mediated mitochondrial fission and the role of Drp1 in exercise adaptations (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__025) (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__035).\n\n- Antioxidant defenses and oxidative stress: Exercise upregulates antioxidant enzymes (including extracellular superoxide dismutase) and resistance exercise decreases oxidative damage while increasing mitochondrial enzyme activity (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__026) (biology_2019, biology_2019__body__031) (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__036).\n\n- Functional outcomes: The pathway-level changes above are associated with increased mitochondrial enzymes and respiration, a mitochondrial phenotype resistant to apoptotic stimuli, and improved insulin sensitivity mediated in part by AMPK (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__036) (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__025) (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__034) (biology_2019, biology_2019__body__031).\n\nNuance and heterogeneity noted in the corpus\n- Some authors note heterogeneity by muscle group, training duration, and age: remodeling patterns observed during the first months of training can differ from patterns seen in lifelong endurance-trained individuals, and muscles differ in their responses to aging and training (s2468867319_2019, s2468867319_2019__introduction__004).

(furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__014)\n- Many mouse strains show sexually dimorphic responses that \u201ccan lead to diametrically opposite effects of caloric restriction on lifespan in males and females\u201d (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__014). (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__014)\n- Studies in nonhuman primates are conflicting: one program (NIA) \u201creported no improvement in lifespan\u201d while another (WNPRC) reported \u201csignificant improvement in both lifespan and healthspan,\u201d demonstrating inconsistency across studies (f1000_2016, f1000_2016__introduction__001). (f1000_2016, f1000_2016__introduction__001)\n- The review authors state that CR \u201cis a severe intervention that results in both beneficial and detrimental effects\u201d (f1000_2016, f1000_2016__abstract__000). (f1000_2016, f1000_2016__abstract__000)\n- In humans, the authors note that \u201cno clear evidence of longevity benefits of bona fide caloric restriction in humans currently exists,\u201d and they list adverse outcomes and practical problems (frailty, reduced cognitive performance, impaired wound healing, immune dysfunction, persistent hunger, psychological effects) that have been reported or are concerns (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__014). (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__014)\n- At the same time, controlled human trials show some favorable intermediate outcomes but heterogeneous effects: the CALERIE trial found that CR participants had a markedly slower increase in biological age compared with ad libitum controls over two years (ad libitum +0.71 years/year vs CR +0.11 years/year), while other reports emphasize that benefits in CALERIE \u201cprimarily segregated to men and individuals with a higher body mass index (BMI)\u201d (nutrients_2024, nutrients_2024__methods__000; furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__014).

Exercise "}]}, "response": {"answer": "In the provided sources the axis responds to exercise as a coordinated, multi-step signalling cascade. Exercise activates AMPK, which both directly drives mitochondrial adaptations and engages SIRT1; AMPK activation during energetic stress is described as a key upstream event (mol_bio_rep_2025, mol_bio_rep_2025__abstract__000; cells_2022, cells_2022__body__024). AMPK can stimulate SIRT1 activity via changes in the NAD+/NADH ratio, linking energy sensing to SIRT1-mediated regulation (mol_bio_rep_2025, mol_bio_rep_2025__abstract__001). SIRT1 deacetylates and thereby enhances PGC-1\u03b1 activity; activated PGC-1\u03b1 then promotes mitochondrial biogenesis (through coactivation of factors such as NRF1 and TFAM) and improves mitochondrial quality control, including mitophagy (mol_bio_rep_2025, mol_bio_rep_2025__abstract__003).\n\nMechanistic evidence tying AMPK to mitophagy and mitochondrial remodeling during exercise is also provided: mitochondria-localized AMPK responds to local energetics and contributes to exercise-induced mitophagy, and AMPK phosphorylation of ULK1 is required to target mitochondria to lysosomes in exercise-induced mitophagy (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__024; cells_2022, cells_2022__body__035). Exercise-associated AMPK activation is further linked to increases in mitochondrial enzymes and to improved muscle insulin sensitivity (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__036; cells_2022, cells_2022__body__034). Finally, an experimental study in aged mice showed that a repeated swimming regimen increased hippocampal SIRT1 and PGC (PGC-1\u03b1) protein levels, supporting that exercise raises these pathway components in vivo (mol_bio_rep_2025, mol_bio_rep_2025__abstract__002).", "citations": [{"source_id": "mol_bio_rep_2025", "chunk_id": "mol_bio_rep_2025__abstract__000", "relevant_quote": "physical exercise is crucial for AMPK activation."}, {"source_id": "cells_2022", "chunk_id": "cells_2022__body__024", "relevant_quote": "Mitochondria-localized AMPK responds to local energetics and contributes to exercise and energetic stress-induced mitophagy."}, {"source_id": "mol_bio_rep_2025", "chunk_id": "mol_bio_rep_2025__abstract__001", "relevant_quote": "which in turn stimulates SIRT1 activity by enhancing the NAD+/ NADH ratio"}, {"source_id": "mol_bio_rep_2025", "chunk_id": "mol_bio_rep_2025__abstract__003", "relevant_quote": "SIRT1 deacetylates PGC-1\u03b1, enhancing its activity and promoting the expression of genes that regulate mitochondrial function"}, {"source_id": "mol_bio_rep_2025", "chunk_id": "mol_bio_rep_2025__abstract__003", "relevant_quote": "PGC-1\u03b1 promotes mitochondrial biogenesis through the coactivation of transcription factors such as nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM)"}, {"source_id": "mol_bio_rep_2025", "chunk_id": "mol_bio_rep_2025__abstract__003", "relevant_quote": "exercise-induced PGC-1\u03b1 activation has been shown to improve mitochondrial quality control by stimulating mitophagy"}, {"source_id": "cells_2022", "chunk_id": "cells_2022__body__035", "relevant_quote": "Ampk phosphorylation of Ulk1 is required for targeting of mitochondria to lysosomes in exercise-induced mitophagy."}, {"source_id": "cells_2022", "chunk_id": "cells_2022__body__036", "relevant_quote": "Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase increases mitochondrial enzymes in skeletal muscle."}, {"source_id": "cells_2022", "chunk_id": "cells_2022__body__034", "relevant_quote": "Enhanced Muscle Insulin Sensitivity After Contraction/Exercise Is Mediated by AMPK."}, {"source_id": "mol_bio_rep_2025", "chunk_id": "mol_bio_rep_2025__abstract__002", "relevant_quote": "The group that exercised more often, Swim 5x, presented significant changes in the following hippocampal proteins: SIRT1, PGC, BCL, and BDNF."}], "confidence": "high", "evidence_quality": "Multiple review and experimental sources in the provided context consistently describe exercise activating AMPK, AMPK engaging SIRT1, and SIRT1 enhancing PGC-1\u03b1 leading to mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy.", "no_evidence": false, "caveats": ["All statements are limited to findings and wording present in the supplied excerpts; other mechanistic details outside these excerpts were not included."]}}

Summarized concisely: \n\n- Age-sensitivity: a biomarker should (1) correlate with multiple age-sensitive features after adjusting for chronological age and (2) be a good predictor of all-cause mortality (AgeDev-related evaluation). (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__001)\n\n- Response criteria: a biomarker should be responsive to both accelerated and decelerated aging (i.e., change with models or exposures that speed or slow aging). (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__003)\n\n- Mechanistic criteria: a valid biomarker should reflect underlying cellular and molecular processes (hallmarks/pillars) of aging. (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__002)\n\n- Generalizability: biomarkers should be evaluated for applicability across tissues, species (when relevant), and human populations (countries, sexes, ethnicities, demographics). (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__002) (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__003)\n\n- Surrogate-endpoint / clinical validation: changes in the biomarker must be shown to predict meaningful clinical benefit (proof via clinical validation); there are not yet any formally validated or likely surrogate endpoint biomarkers of aging. (cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__001) (cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__004)\n\n- Distinction of what is being measured: clearly distinguish biomarkers of biological age (extent of aging, \"odometer\") from biomarkers of the rate/pace of aging (\"speedometer\"); both can be complementary. (cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__002)\n\n- Practical/sample considerations: the choice of biological sample matters because some assays (e.g., blood-based) may primarily reflect specific systems (e.g., hematopoietic); temporal dynamics and cell-type specificity must be considered. (cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__002)\n\n- Integrative/composite performance: composite multisystem (integrative) biomarkers are generally more robust and correlate more strongly with other aging features than single biomarkers. (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__001)\n\n- Validation across cohorts and contexts: a key step is validation of biomarkers across multiple human cohorts to assess robustness and limits of utility.

(See citations below.)\n\n- Improved mitochondrial quantity and quality: endurance/aerobic training increases expression of the transcriptional co-activator PGC-1\u03b1, which drives mitochondrial biogenesis, and exercise preserves mitochondrial function in older active adults similar to younger active adults (cells_2022__body__005; s2468867319_2019__introduction__002).\n\n- Enhanced mitochondrial proteostasis and mitophagy: upregulation of mitochondrial protein turnover / mitophagy with exercise is linked to improved mitochondrial maintenance and, in an animal study, to muscle hypertrophy in aged mice (s2468867319_2019__introduction__003; cells_2022__body__005).\n\n- Maintenance of proteostasis and protein synthesis/degradation balance: endurance exercise is a robust promoter of proteostatic mechanisms, and exercise training can reduce proteolytic ubiquitin ligases associated with muscle wasting (s2468867319_2019__introduction__003; cells_2022__body__006).\n\n- Suppression of negative growth regulators: both endurance and resistance exercise decrease muscle and plasma myostatin levels, which may mitigate muscle wasting (cells_2022__body__006).\n\n- Preservation of neuromuscular function: endurance training improves motor unit (MU) and neuromuscular junction (NMJ) function, helping to prevent age-related losses in muscle size and function (s2468867319_2019__introduction__001).\n\n- Vascular and fiber-type adaptations that support muscle health: endurance training promotes angiogenesis (PGC-1\u03b1\u2013dependent) and fiber-type transformations associated with endurance adaptations, improving oxygen and nutrient delivery and contractile properties (cells_2022__body__007).\n\n- Improved muscle metabolic handling: muscle contraction and endurance training increase insulin sensitivity and stimulate GLUT4 translocation, mediated in part by AMPK and TBC1D1 signaling, supporting energy supply to muscle (cells_2022__body__007).\n\nTaken together, the sources describe a multifactorial model in which aerobic exercise sustains mitochondrial health, proteostasis, neuromuscular integrity, and vascular/metabolic support, all of which contribute to preserved muscle mass and function with age.

(cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__000) (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__008)\n\n- Both stress the importance of mechanistic grounding (biomarkers reflecting underlying cellular/molecular aging processes) and warn about data-driven correlates that may be uninterpretable or noncausal. (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__002) (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__008)\n\n- Both endorse composite/multisystem approaches and inclusion of functional/physiological measures to improve robustness and relevance of aging biomarkers. (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__001) (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__008)\n\n- Both call for standardization and cross-cohort / longitudinal validation before molecular clocks are used widely as surrogate endpoints. (cell_2023, cell_2023__conclusion__000) (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__009)\n\nWhere they differ in emphasis or interpretation\n\n- Emphasis on physiological biomarkers vs molecular clocks: Furrer & Handschin place physiological/functional biomarkers (e.g., cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle mass/strength, gait speed) at the center and describe them as strong, practical predictors of morbidity and mortality and as benchmarks for new molecular biomarkers. (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__010) (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__009)\n\n  By contrast, the Cell framework focuses on building a broad, classification-and-validation framework for molecular and other biomarkers (defining terms like biological age and AgeDev, and distinguishing \"odometer\" vs \"speedometer\" biomarkers), while recognizing both the promise and current limits of molecular clocks. (cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__000) (cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__002)\n\n- Tone about current molecular clocks: Furrer & Handschin are more skeptical about current molecular clocks\u2019 physiological/functional relevance and predictive overlap, noting inconsistent results between clocks, technical variability, and that many molecular clocks still \"have to be used with caution\" pending longitudinal validation. (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__006) (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__008)\n\n  The Cell paper acknowledges data-driven clocks can predict chronological age and mortality well but warns about over-interpreting them as direct measures of biological aging without mechanistic or outcome links; it emphasizes designing biomarkers to capture either biological age or the pace of aging and using outcome-driven training where possible. (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__001) (cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__002)\n\n- Recommendations for next steps: Furrer & Handschin highlight physiological biomarkers as immediately useful \"benchmarks\" and argue multi-component measures that capture systemic/multiorgan health may currently have the highest chance to monitor aging progression and assess interventions. (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__010) (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__008)\n\n  The Cell framework lays out the conceptual distinctions (e.g., AgeDev vs pace) and regulatory/validation pathways to advance biomarkers toward surrogate endpoints, and stresses inclusion of functional age-related outcomes in model training. (cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__000) (cell_2023, cell_2023__conclusion__000)\n\nNet takeaways\n\n- Substantive agreement on key evaluation principles (validation, mechanistic plausibility, generalizability, standardization) and on the value of integrating functional/physiological measures.\n\n- Main difference is emphasis: Furrer & Handschin prioritize physiological/functional biomarkers as currently most actionable and treat molecular clocks with caution; the Cell paper provides a broader methodological framework that accepts molecular clocks\u2019 utility but stresses careful validation, interpretability, and the distinction between biological age and rate-of-aging biomarkers.\n\nIf you want, I can extract and tabulate the key textual excerpts from each paper that illustrate these points.", "citations": [{"source_id": "cell_2023", "chunk_id": "cell_2023__methods__000", "relevant_quote": "Biomarker of aging A quantitative parameter of an organism that either alone or in a composite predicts biological age and ideally its changes in response to interventions"}, {"source_id": "furrer_handschin_2025", "chunk_id": "furrer_handschin_2025__results__008", "relevant_quote": "First, biomarkers are especially valuable when they originate from pathways that actively drive aging (biological validation) rather than simply being correlated with this process."}, {"source_id": "cell_2023", "chunk_id": "cell_2023__results__001", "relevant_quote": "many existing biomarkers of aging perform very well in predicting chronological age, future mortality, and possible response to interventions"}, {"source_id": "furrer_handschin_2025", "chunk_id": "furrer_handschin_2025__results__008", "relevant_quote": "compound measures and indices that describe systemic, or at least multiorgan, health, relevant for resilience and functional retention, might have the highest chance to monitor aging progression"}, {"source_id": "cell_2023", "chunk_id": "cell_2023__conclusion__000", "relevant_quote": "Biomarkers of aging offer great potential for enabling human longevity intervention trials and personalized clinical decision making."}, {"source_id": "furrer_handschin_2025", "chunk_id": "furrer_handschin_2025__results__009", "relevant_quote": "physical activity remains one of the best interventions for human health and longevity."}, {"source_id": "furrer_handschin_2025", "chunk_id": "furrer_handschin_2025__results__010", "relevant_quote": "cardiorespiratory fitness is the most studied and best predictor of morbidity and all-cause as well as disease-related mortality"}, {"source_id": "cell_2023", "chunk_id": "cell_2023__methods__002", "relevant_quote": "An important conceptual distinction needs to be made between biomarkers of biological age and biomarkers of the rate of aging."}, {"source_id": "furrer_handschin_2025", "chunk_id": "furrer_handschin_2025__results__006", "relevant_quote": "At the moment, no consensus on methodology and clock as standard biomarker for human aging has emerged."}, {"source_id": "furrer_handschin_2025", "chunk_id": "furrer_handschin_2025__results__006", "relevant_quote": "for most of these biomarkers, the physiological and functional relevance are unclear, the predictive value for morbidity and mortality in humans is poor"}], "confidence": "high", "evidence_quality": "high", "no_evidence": false, "caveats": ["This comparison is limited to the specific excerpts provided from the two sources; both papers contain broader detail beyond the quoted fragments."]}}

nutrients_2024, nutrients_2024__results__000).  \n- AMPK and mTOR: CR activates AMPK (via lower ATP) which inhibits mTORC1 and promotes autophagy; this cascade is emphasized as a central mechanistic route for CR effects (nutrients_2024, nutrients_2024__results__001).  \n- IF/periodic effects: IF and periodic fasting share many pathways with CR (reduced glucose/insulin), but their cyclic nature can alter activation timing and magnitude of these pathways; IF may produce pronounced effects on insulin sensitivity and enhance cellular stress\u2011response mechanisms (e.g., heat shock proteins, sirtuins) compared to continuous CR (nutrients_2024, nutrients_2024__results__001; f1000_2016, f1000_2016__introduction__002).  \n- Fasting\u2011mimicking diets: FMDs are grouped with periodic or targeted dietary restrictions that aim to reproduce fasting effects without continuous calorie restriction or complete lack of food intake, i.e., periodic interventions that can mimic fasting biology (f1000_2016, f1000_2016__introduction__002; f1000_2016, f1000_2016__conclusion__000). \n\nEvidence for longevity/healthspan benefits\n- Model organisms: CR is described as the most effective and reproducible dietary intervention to extend healthy lifespan across many model organisms (from yeast to primates) (f1000_2016, f1000_2016__abstract__000; f1000_2016, f1000_2016__introduction__000).  \n- Nonhuman primates: Results are mixed \u2014 one rhesus\u2011monkey study reported no lifespan improvement but a positive trend for delayed age\u2011related disease, while another reported significant improvement in both lifespan and healthspan; differences were attributed to diet composition and genetic background (f1000_2016, f1000_2016__introduction__001).  \n- Humans (CR): Controlled human trials (CALERIE) show CR is feasible and provides health benefits (reduced inflammatory markers and cardiometabolic risk factors) but is also associated with adverse effects such as reduced bone mineral density; overall, \"no clear evidence of longevity benefits of bona fide caloric restriction in humans currently exists\" in the provided context (f1000_2016, f1000_2016__introduction__001; furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__014).  \n- IF and periodic fasting: The supplied context states that intermittent and periodic fasting can increase lifespan in model systems even without an overall decrease in calorie intake, and that IF shows short\u2011term improvements in body composition and cardiovascular markers plus some longer\u2011term metabolic changes in humans (f1000_2016, f1000_2016__introduction__002; nutrients_2024, nutrients_2024__results__001).  \n- FMDs: The context groups fasting\u2011mimicking diets with periodic interventions that can reproduce fasting biology without chronic caloric restriction, but direct longevity outcomes in humans for FMDs are not presented in the excerpts provided (f1000_2016, f1000_2016__introduction__002; f1000_2016, f1000_2016__conclusion__000). \n\nImportant modifiers and caveats (from the supplied texts)\n- Genetic background, sex, diet composition, and baseline intake can strongly modify responses to CR and related interventions (f1000_2016, f1000_2016__introduction__001; furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__014).  \n- Study heterogeneity and methodological variability limit generalizability and causal inference across human studies (nutrients_2024, nutrients_2024__results__002). \n\nBottom line (as supported by the provided context): Mechanistically, CR, IF, and FMDs converge on the same nutrient\u2011sensing and stress\u2011response pathways (mTORC1, AMPK, insulin/IGF signaling, autophagy, stress\u2011resistance), but differ in regimen and timing, which can affect pathway activation.

Specifically: \n\n- Autophagy/mitophagy and coupling to biogenesis: Several studies report that exercise increases basal autophagy/mitophagy flux and that mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis are tightly coupled during exercise-induced muscle adaptation (ju_2016, ju_2016__results__003). Short-term inhibition of autophagy can abolish exercise-induced increases in mitochondrial biogenesis markers, indicating autophagy is permissive for biogenesis (ju_2016, ju_2016__results__002). \n\n- Mitophagy machinery: Removal of damaged mitochondria during exercise is described as requiring general autophagy plus priming of mitochondria, with priming mediated by PINK1/Parkin or mitophagy receptors such as Nix and Bnip3 (ju_2016, ju_2016__results__000). Exercise training increases Bnip3 in skeletal muscle, consistent with receptor-mediated mitophagy involvement (ju_2016, ju_2016__results__002). \n\n- Energy-sensing kinases and upstream signaling: Exercise-related mitochondrial responses implicate energy/redox-sensitive kinases. Examples cited include mitochondria-localized AMPK contributing to exercise- and energetic stress-induced mitophagy, and signaling pathways such as AMPK, CaMK and PKD being implicated in crosstalk between mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__024; ju_2016, ju_2016__results__003). Exercise also stimulates PGC-1\u03b1 transcription via p38 MAPK, linking kinase signaling to transcriptional control of biogenesis (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__024). \n\n- Mitochondrial dynamics (fusion/fission): Endurance exercise training increases proteins involved in mitochondrial fusion and fission (examples: MFN1/2, Opa1, Drp1, Fis1), indicating remodeling of mitochondrial network dynamics as a shared adaptation (ju_2016, ju_2016__results__002; ju_2016, ju_2016__results__000). \n\n- Quality and function (fitness, antioxidant responses): Exercise is associated with improved mitochondrial quality (not just quantity) across fitness levels, and resistance exercise increases antioxidant enzyme activity and mitochondrial enzyme activity in older adults, indicating redox/antioxidant remodeling accompanies mitochondrial adaptations (biology_2019, biology_2019__body__030; biology_2019, biology_2019__body__031). Acute exercise increases extracellular superoxide dismutase expression in muscle and aorta, an example of exercise-induced antioxidant response (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__026). \n\n- Functional rescue and proteostatic remodeling: Exercise can reestablish autophagic flux and mitochondrial quality control in pathological states (e.g., heart failure) and can remodel mitochondrial proteostasis during the initiation of a new endurance-training program (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__025; s2468867319_2019, s2468867319_2019__introduction__004). \n\nTaken together, the shared molecular themes across the corpus are: activation of autophagy/mitophagy (PINK1/Parkin and receptor-mediated routes), coordination between mitophagy and PGC-1\u03b1\u2013linked mitochondrial biogenesis, regulation by energy/redox-sensitive kinases (AMPK, CaMK, PKD, p38 MAPK), remodeling of fusion/fission machinery, and accompanying antioxidant adjustments.

Related work using life\u2011table modelling found that very small combined increases (for example, +5 min/day sleep, +1.9 min/day MVPA, +5 DQS) were associated with about one additional year of lifespan. The studies also report a synergistic pattern: diet quality was most protective when combined with more optimal sleep and physical activity.

Specifically: \n\n- In rodents, responses to CR are heterogeneous: \u201ca considerable number of mouse strains react only very little, and some even experience a negative, life-shortening effect\u201d (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__013). CR has also been associated with suboptimal health in some mice, for example \u201closs of lean mass, compromised immune system function, or disruption of erythroid cell populations\u201d (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__014). \n\n- Sex and genetic background matter: a \u201csexually dimorphic response is seen in many mouse strains, which can lead to diametrically opposite effects of caloric restriction on lifespan in males and females\u201d (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__014). The authors emphasize heredity and strain differences as major determinants of lifespan response to dietary restriction (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__013). \n\n- In primate and human studies the picture is mixed: one rhesus-monkey program reported \u201cno improvement in lifespan\u201d while another reported lifespan benefits, with differences attributed to diet composition and other trial differences (f1000_2016, f1000_2016__introduction__001). The reviewed synthesis states that \u201cno clear evidence of longevity benefits of bona fide caloric restriction in humans currently exists\u201d (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__014). At the same time, the human CALERIE trial showed that CR \u201cled to slower biological aging compared to the ad libitum approach,\u201d indicating improved biomarkers though not direct evidence of increased human longevity (nutrients_2024, nutrients_2024__methods__000). \n\nOverall: animal data include reproducible instances where CR shortens lifespan or causes suboptimal health depending on strain and sex, and primate/human results are inconsistent \u2014 humans show some biomarker improvements but no clear evidence of increased longevity.

Exercise increased autophagic flux in skeletal muscle, and short-term inhibition of autophagy abolished the exercise-induced increases in mitochondrial biogenesis markers and reversed trained adaptations. The study also links exercise-induced increases in mitochondrial fusion/fission proteins and an increase in the mitophagy receptor Bnip3 (with no change in PINK1/Parkin) to this coordinated response.\n\nKey points:\n- The authors conclude that \u201cautophagy plays an important role in mitochondrial biogenesis\u201d during endurance exercise adaptation (ju_2016, ju_2016__abstract__000). (ju_2016, ju_2016__abstract__000)\n- Swimming training increased autophagic flux (measured as an increase in LC3-II) in mouse skeletal muscle (ju_2016, ju_2016__abstract__000). (ju_2016, ju_2016__abstract__000)\n- When mitophagy/autophagy was inhibited pharmacologically (colchicine), the exercise-induced increases in mitochondrial biogenesis markers (PGC-1\u03b1, SDH, COX IV, CS activity) were abolished (ju_2016, ju_2016__results__002; ju_2016, ju_2016__results__004). (ju_2016, ju_2016__results__002) (ju_2016, ju_2016__results__004)\n- The authors state that mitochondrial turnover is rapid and that \u201ca short-term inhibition of autophagy is sufficient to reverse/abolish the effects of 8 weeks of exercise training\u201d (ju_2016, ju_2016__results__002). (ju_2016, ju_2016__results__002)\n- Exercise increased mitochondrial fusion and fission proteins (MFN2, Opa1, Drp1) in this model, which the authors relate to the elevated autophagy/mitophagy (ju_2016, ju_2016__results__000). (ju_2016, ju_2016__results__000)\n- The mitophagy receptor Bnip3 was increased with exercise (and further increased with colchicine), whereas PINK1/Parkin protein levels were unchanged in this study, implicating Bnip3-mediated mitophagy in the exercise response (ju_2016, ju_2016__abstract__000; ju_2016, ju_2016__results__001).

These mechanisms are supported by human and animal studies in the provided excerpts, and the review notes the mechanisms are multifaceted and that additional research is still needed.\n\nKey mechanisms (evidence from the provided excerpts):\n- Maintains mitochondrial content and function (biogenesis, respiration): older physically active adults have mitochondrial function similar to young active adults (s2468867319_2019, s2468867319_2019__introduction__002). Exercise increases mitochondrial complexes and content (s2468867319_2019, s2468867319_2019__introduction__003) and upregulates PGC-1\u03b1 which is responsible for increased mitochondrial biogenesis after exercise (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__005). Regular activity can delay age-related decline in mitochondrial respiratory flux in animal models (s2468867319_2019, s2468867319_2019__introduction__004).\n\n- Supports mitochondrial proteostasis and mitophagy: enhancement of mitochondrial protein turnover by upregulation of mitophagy produces muscle hypertrophy in aged mice (s2468867319_2019, s2468867319_2019__introduction__003), and exercise may help maintain organ function through upregulating mitophagy (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__005).\n\n- Lowers negative regulators of muscle mass and promotes anabolic signaling / reduces proteolysis: both endurance and resistance exercise decrease muscle and plasma myostatin (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__006); exercise-associated protein synthesis via anabolic signaling such as the Akt-mTOR pathway is linked to improved muscle mass (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__006); exercise training can reduce proteolytic ubiquitin ligases MuRF-1 and Atrogin-1 (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__006).\n\n- Promotes angiogenesis and fiber-type remodeling that support muscle function: PGC-1\u03b1 is a key regulator of angiogenesis in skeletal muscle and muscle-specific Pgc-1\u03b1 deletion blunts exercise-induced angiogenesis (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__007); endurance training induces fiber-type transformation via the calcineurin\u2013NFAT pathway (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__007).\n\nEvidence that these effects preserve mass/function: the review states that aerobic exercise preserves skeletal muscle mass and function with age (s2468867319_2019, s2468867319_2019__introduction__000) and cites human studies of lifelong exercisers and interventions started later in life showing mitochondrial and related benefits (s2468867319_2019, s2468867319_2019__introduction__002; s2468867319_2019, s2468867319_2019__introduction__003).\n\nCaveat: the review concludes the mechanisms are multifaceted and that additional research is still needed to fully explain how aerobic exercise preserves muscle mass and function with age (s2468867319_2019, s2468867319_2019__conclusion__000).", "citations": [{"source_id": "s2468867319_2019", "chunk_id": "s2468867319_2019__introduction__000", "relevant_quote": "a growing body of evidence supports that aerobic exercise preserves skeletal muscle mass and function with age through a variety of mechanisms."}, {"source_id": "s2468867319_2019", "chunk_id": "s2468867319_2019__introduction__002", "relevant_quote": "older subjects who were physically active (i.e. 3 d/wk of aerobic exercise consistently over the previous 6 months) have similar mitochondrial function to young physically active individuals"}, {"source_id": "s2468867319_2019", "chunk_id": "s2468867319_2019__introduction__003", "relevant_quote": "16 weeks of moderate intensity aerobic exercise increased the abundance of individual mitochondrial complexes and promoted mitochondrial supercomplex formation"}, {"source_id": "s2468867319_2019", "chunk_id": "s2468867319_2019__introduction__004", "relevant_quote": "Mitochondrial respiratory flux declined with age, and lifelong wheel running access delayed this decline until 18 months"}, {"source_id": "cells_2022", "chunk_id": "cells_2022__body__005", "relevant_quote": "increases in transcription and abundance of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor co-activator (PGC-1\u03b1)... is responsible for increased mitochondrial biogenesis after exercise"}, {"source_id": "s2468867319_2019", "chunk_id": "s2468867319_2019__introduction__003", "relevant_quote": "Enhancement of mitochondrial protein turnover by upregulation of mitophagy produces muscle hypertrophy in aged mice"}, {"source_id": "cells_2022", "chunk_id": "cells_2022__body__005", "relevant_quote": "exercise may help maintain cardiac function through upregulating mitophagy"}, {"source_id": "cells_2022", "chunk_id": "cells_2022__body__006", "relevant_quote": "Both endurance exercise and resistance exercise decrease muscle and plasma levels of myostatin"}, {"source_id": "cells_2022", "chunk_id": "cells_2022__body__006", "relevant_quote": "protein synthesis via anabolic signaling, such as the Akt-mTOR pathway, is also associated with improvement in muscle mass by exercise training"}, {"source_id": "cells_2022", "chunk_id": "cells_2022__body__006", "relevant_quote": "proteolytic ubiquitin ligases, like MuRF-1 and Atrogin-1, which contribute to muscle wasting, can be reduced by exercise training"}, {"source_id": "cells_2022", "chunk_id": "cells_2022__body__007", "relevant_quote": "PGC-1\u03b1 has emerged as a key regulator of angiogenesis in skeletal muscle"}, {"source_id": "cells_2022", "chunk_id": "cells_2022__body__007", "relevant_quote": "fiber type transformation induced by endurance exercise training in the direction of type IIb/IId/x to IIa fibers appear to be caused by activation of the calcineurin-nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) pathway"}, {"source_id": "s2468867319_2019", "chunk_id": "s2468867319_2019__conclusion__000", "relevant_quote": "We highlighted three potential mechanisms, but additional research is still needed on how aerobic exercise... preserves muscle mass, and function with age."}], "confidence": "high", "evidence_quality": "Supported by multiple human and animal studies in the provided excerpts (see citations).", "no_evidence": false, "caveats": ["The review states the mechanisms are multifaceted and that additional research is still needed (s2468867319_2019, s2468867319_2019__conclusion__000)."]}}

(furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__008) (cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__001)\n- Mechanistic relevance: both require biomarkers to reflect underlying biology/mechanisms of aging. (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__002) (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__009)\n- Generalizability / cross-cohort and cross-species considerations: both discuss the need to assess applicability across tissues, populations, and species.

(furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__008) (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__001)\n- Promise of plasma proteomics / proteomic clocks: both note plasma proteomics as a promising avenue among molecular/omic approaches. (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__006) (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__002)\n\nWhere they differ (emphasis / framing)\n- Physiological biomarkers vs molecular-first framing: Furrer & Handschin position physiological/functional biomarkers (cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle mass/strength, neuromuscular function, frailty) as \u201cready for prime time\u201d and underappreciated benchmarks, and explicitly recommend using physiological biomarkers to benchmark molecular biomarkers.

(furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__009)\n  The Cell paper focuses more on classification, validation stages, and clinical/regulatory uses rather than enumerating costs and invasiveness in the same checklist form in these excerpts. (cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__000)\n- Sources of concern emphasized: Furrer & Handschin give concrete examples of technical variability, tissue-specific differences, circadian effects, and overlap with disease states as reasons for caution about molecular clocks. They note epigenetic clocks differ between organs and can be affected by circadian rhythms and infection/pregnancy, and advise using molecular clocks with caution until longitudinal validation.

(cell_2023, cell_2023__results__001)\n- Recommended endpoint types / integration: Cell highlights the conceptual distinction between measures of the progress of aging (biological age / age deviation) and measures of the pace of aging, and argues integrative, multisystem biomarkers tend to be more robust. (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__002) Furrer & Handschin emphasize that, given incomplete mechanistic knowledge, compound/systemic measures (and benchmarking against physiological markers) may be most useful, while stressing physiological biomarkers are already validated and indispensable.

IF has been reported to give short-term improvements in body composition and cardiovascular markers, and its extended fasting periods may produce more pronounced improvements in insulin sensitivity and stronger activation of cellular stress-response pathways (for example, heat shock proteins and sirtuins). In model organisms, intermittent and periodic fasting can increase lifespan even without large overall calorie reduction.\n\n\nComparative takeaways\n- Overlap in mechanisms: All three approaches converge on nutrient-sensing pathways (mTORC1, AMPK, sirtuins) and on reduced insulin/IGF-1 signaling and related downstream effects (e.g., autophagy). \nHowever, translation to clear longevity benefits in humans remains unresolved.\n- Important caveats: genetic background, sex, study design, and adherence influence outcomes and can lead to variable or even adverse responses (e.g., loss of

By contrast, the Cell (Moqri et al.) framework is centered on constructing and evaluating molecular/omic biomarkers (epigenetic, proteomic, etc.) within a standardized classification and validation framework (cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__000; cell_2023, cell_2023__results__002).\n- Tone on molecular clocks: Furrer & Handschin highlight substantial practical and biological limitations of current molecular/epigenetic clocks (lack of consensus, poor predictive overlap between clocks, tissue differences, circadian and acute perturbation effects, and the need for longitudinal validation) (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__006; furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__007; furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__008). Moqri et al.

Furrer & Handschin also endorse cross-species validation as valuable but place comparatively greater practical emphasis on physiological measures applicable across humans and on using physiological benchmarks for molecular clocks (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__008; furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__009).\n\nPractical implications they imply (from the texts)\n- Use physiological/functional biomarkers as essential benchmarks when developing molecular clocks (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__009).\n\nConfidence: high", "citations": [{"source_id": "cell_2023", "chunk_id": "cell_2023__results__001", "relevant_quote": "A valid biomarker of aging should reflect these underlying cellular and molecular processes."}, {"source_id": "furrer_handschin_2025", "chunk_id": "furrer_handschin_2025__results__008", "relevant_quote": "Classification: How can the biomarker be used? 1) Predictive (e.g., for aging trajectories... )"}, {"source_id": "cell_2023", "chunk_id": "cell_2023__results__003", "relevant_quote": "Examples of dual-species94 and pan- mammalian95 epigenetic biomarkers of age have been reported."}, {"source_id": "furrer_handschin_2025", "chunk_id": "furrer_handschin_2025__results__009", "relevant_quote": "PHYSIOLOGICAL BIOMARKERS OF AGING: READY FOR PRIME TIME!"}, {"source_id": "cell_2023", "chunk_id": "cell_2023__results__001", "relevant_quote": "composite multisystem biomarkers are more robust and show a stronger correlation with other features of aging than single biomarkers of aging."}, {"source_id": "furrer_handschin_2025", "chunk_id": "furrer_handschin_2025__results__008", "relevant_quote": "Assessment: How can the biomarker be measured? 1) Feasibility and validity of measurements... 2) Mechanistic underpinnings and biological plausibility... 3) Generalizability..."}, {"source_id": "cell_2023", "chunk_id": "cell_2023__methods__000", "relevant_quote": "we formed the Biomarkers of Aging Consortium (https://www.agingconsortium.org) to engage a multi- disciplinary panel"}, {"source_id": "furrer_handschin_2025", "chunk_id": "furrer_handschin_2025__results__006", "relevant_quote": "At the moment, no consensus on methodology and clock as standard biomarker for human aging has emerged."}, {"source_id": "furrer_handschin_2025", "chunk_id": "furrer_handschin_2025__results__007", "relevant_quote": "epigenetic clocks differ between organs and cell types... time of sampling can affect the results, as many epigenetic clocks exhibit circadian oscillations."}, {"source_id": "cell_2023", "chunk_id": "cell_2023__results__002", "relevant_quote": "data-driven approaches create new challenges in evaluating validity: in the absence of underlying biological or interpretable models, algorithms are likely to detect a mix of features that can cause aging or be caused by the aging process."}, {"source_id": "furrer_handschin_2025", "chunk_id": "furrer_handschin_2025__results__009", "relevant_quote": "proven, physiological biomarkers of aging should be used to benchmark any new molecular biomarkers"}, {"source_id": "furrer_handschin_2025", "chunk_id": "furrer_handschin_2025__results__008", "relevant_quote": "awaiting validation in longitudinal human studies in large cohorts"}], "confidence": "medium", "evidence_quality": "multiple explicit statements across the provided excerpts from both sources", "no_evidence": false, "caveats": ["Entity guard: removed 1 sentence(s) containing terms not found in context: ['Cell Consortium']"]}}

Mechanistically, CR is widely linked to down-regulation of nutrient- and growth-related signaling such as \u201cinsulin and insulin-like signalling (IIS) \u2026 the amino signalling target of rapamycin (TOR)-S6 kinase pathway, and the glucose signalling Ras-protein kinase A (PKA) pathway.\u201d (f1000_2016, f1000_2016__introduction__000). CR also activates AMPK due to lower ATP levels, which then inhibits mTORC1 and promotes autophagy, according to the provided review. (nutrients_2024, nutrients_2024__results__001).\n\n- Intermittent fasting (IF): IF and periodic fasting share many pathways with CR but differ in temporal pattern. IF \u201cdemonstrates short-term improvements in body composition, cardiovascular markers, and cardiovascular risk scores, while also showing long-term benefits such as enhanced cholesterol levels, modulation of thyroid function, increased secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH), lower levels of sICAM-1, and depletion of the pro-aging amino acid methionine.\u201d (nutrients_2024, nutrients_2024__results__001). The cyclic fasting/feeding of IF \u201cmay lead to more pronounced improvements in insulin sensitivity\u201d and this periodic metabolic stress \u201cmay also enhance cellular stress response mechanisms more robustly than CR,\u201d including \u201cupregulating protective pathways such as heat shock proteins and sirtuins.\u201d (nutrients_2024, nutrients_2024__results__001). Evidence from model systems supports lifespan increases with intermittent/periodic fasting: \u201cBoth intermittent and periodic fasting can increase lifespan, even when there is little or no overall decrease in calorie intake.\u201d (f1000_2016, f1000_2016__introduction__002).\n\nThe same source reports that such regimens have been associated with \u201cenhanced healthspan and rejuvenated the hematopoietic system while promoting adult neurogenesis.\u201d (f1000_2016, f1000_2016__introduction__003).\n\n- Shared targets and distinctions: Reviews emphasize that dietary interventions converge on nutrient-sensing pathways: \u201cBy modulating nutrient-sensing pathways such as mTORC1, AMPK, and sirtuins, dietary regimens exert pleiotropic effects on cellular metabolism.\u201d (nutrients_2024, nutrients_2024__results__000).\n\n- Evidence limitations and caveats: Despite strong model\u2011organism results, translational evidence in primates and humans is mixed: two primate studies reported discordant lifespan outcomes (one reported \u201cno improvement in lifespan\u201d while the other reported \u201csignificant improvement in both lifespan and healthspan\u201d), illustrating variability across studies. (f1000_2016, f1000_2016__introduction__001). The review also notes that \u201cno clear evidence of longevity benefits of bona fide caloric restriction in humans currently exists.\u201d (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__014). Methodological and population variability further complicate interpretation: \u201cVariability in study designs, participant characteristics, and dietary protocols complicates the interpretation and generalizability of findings.\u201d (nutrients_2024, nutrients_2024__results__002).

These mitochondrial effects have been linked to muscle strength and mobility.

(s2468867319_2019, s2468867319_2019__introduction__003)\n\n3) Anabolic vs. catabolic signaling and protein turnover: Endurance exercise decreases myostatin levels, is associated with activation of anabolic signaling pathways (e.g., Akt\u2013mTOR) that support protein synthesis, and reduces proteolytic ubiquitin ligases (MuRF-1, Atrogin-1) that drive muscle wasting \u2014 all actions that can help conserve or increase muscle mass. (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__006)\n\n4) Neuromuscular preservation and muscle quality: Endurance training improves motor unit and neuromuscular junction function and is associated with greater numbers of activatable motor units in very old athletes; lifelong aerobic training also preserves capillarization and can increase fiber contractile performance (improved strength/velocity in specific fiber types) even without increased fiber size. These neuromuscular and microvascular adaptations support muscle function and likely help prevent atrophy.

Examples from intervention studies include: \n\n- DNA methylation (gene-specific and global): methylation changes were observed in glycemia-related loci (e.g., TXNIP, LINE-1, LUMA) (nutrients_2023a, nutrients_2023a__body__001; nutrients_2023a, nutrients_2023a__body__010), lipid-related loci (e.g., CPT1A, BMAL1, ADRB3, LINE-1) (nutrients_2023a, nutrients_2023a__body__003; nutrients_2023a, nutrients_2023a__body__010), blood-pressure\u2013related loci (e.g., LINC00319, ACOT13, KCNV1, NR3C1, RBM9, CDYL, GATA4, TBPL2) (nutrients_2023a, nutrients_2023a__body__005; nutrients_2023a, nutrients_2023a__body__010), inflammatory genes (e.g., TNF, IL6, FCER2, DUSP10, BCL2, CD6, CRP) after exercise or dietary programs (nutrients_2023a, nutrients_2023a__body__006; nutrients_2023a, nutrients_2023a__body__010), and adipokine-related genes (e.g., RNF39, COL4A1, CD36, CD14, FADS1, PDK4) (nutrients_2023a, nutrients_2023a__body__007; nutrients_2023a, nutrients_2023a__body__010).

The review lists miRNAs associated with glycemic responses (e.g., miR-99b, miR-128-1-5p, miR-374a-5p, miR-221-3p, miR-21, miR-106b, let-7c, miR-17, miR-296, miR-20b, miR-92a, miR-93, miR-186, miR-192, miR-342, miR-374b, miR-22, miR-145, miR-126, miR-29a, miR-28-3p, miR-150, miR-34a, miR-210) (nutrients_2023a, nutrients_2023a__body__010; nutrients_2023a, nutrients_2023a__body__001; nutrients_2023a, nutrients_2023a__body__003). Example: larger decreases in serum miR-99b were associated with lower fasting glucose after an 18-month hypocaloric diet plus physical activity intervention (nutrients_2023a, nutrients_2023a__body__001).

(cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__000) (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__009)\n\n- Both prioritize mechanistic relevance: biomarkers should reflect underlying biology or pathways that drive aging rather than merely correlate with age (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__002; furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__008). (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__002) (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__008)\n\n- Both require validation across contexts (e.g., tissues, species, cohorts) and call for longitudinal human cohort validation before routine use (cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__001; furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__008). (cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__001) (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__008)\n\n- Both recognize specific assay-level validation needs (analytical and clinical validation) and discuss regulatory/surrogate-endpoint implications if biomarkers predict clinical benefit (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__009; cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__001). (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__009) (cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__001)\n\n- Both note promise in molecular/multi-omics approaches (e.g., epigenetic clocks, proteomic clocks, plasma proteomics) while recognizing current limitations (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__002; furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__006). (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__002) (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__006)\n\nKey differences / emphasis\n- Emphasis on physiological biomarkers: Furrer & Handschin explicitly argue that physiological (functional) biomarkers are \"ready for prime time\" and are strong, established predictors of morbidity and mortality, recommending them as benchmarks (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__010; furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__009). (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__010) (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__009)\n  By contrast, the Cell framework (Moqri et al.) places more emphasis on creating a consensus terminology and evaluation pathway for molecular biomarkers and on advancing molecular biomarkers (including epigenetic and proteomic) toward regulatory uses and surrogate endpoints, while acknowledging the complementary role of vitality/resilience and functional measures (cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__000; cell_2023, cell_2023__conclusion__000; cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__001). (cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__000) (cell_2023, cell_2023__conclusion__000) (cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__001)\n\n- Skepticism vs. pragmatic development: Furrer & Handschin express stronger caution about current molecular clocks \u2014 noting lack of consensus, variable predictive value, tissue specificity, circadian and technical variability, and substantial replicate deviations \u2014 and argue for careful benchmarking against physiological measures (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__006; furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__007; furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__008). (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__006) (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__007) (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__008)\n  Moqri et al. (Cell) are forward-looking about deploying validated molecular biomarkers in trials and regulatory settings, and note that some candidate methylation-based biomarkers and omics-derived biomarkers have already shown predictive, prognostic, or response properties, while still calling for further cross-cohort validation (cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__001; cell_2023, cell_2023__results__002). (cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__001) (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__002)\n\n- Framing of generalizability: both include generalizability as a criterion, but Furrer & Handschin list practical constraints (costs, invasiveness, applicability across demographics) explicitly in their framework, elevating these implementation factors as assessment axes (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__009). (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__009)\n  Moqri et al. discuss generalizability in terms of cross-tissue and cross-species utility and emphasize cohort/validation needs and regulatory use cases (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__002; cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__001). (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__002) (cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__001)\n\nPractical intersection: both recommend (explicitly or implicitly) that molecular biomarkers be benchmarked against meaningful physiological/clinical outcomes (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__009) and that molecular clocks be validated longitudinally in humans before routine use (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__008; cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__001). (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__009) (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__008) (cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__001)\n\nOverall takeaway\n- The two frameworks are largely aligned on principles (mechanistic relevance, analytical/clinical validation, generalizability, and cohort validation), but differ in emphasis: Furrer & Handschin stress that physiological/functional biomarkers are presently most robust and should serve as benchmarks, and they are more skeptical about current molecular clocks; Moqri et al. (Cell) focus on building consensus frameworks, advancing selected molecular biomarkers (including epigenetic and proteomic clocks) toward regulatory and trial use, and on standardizing terminology and validation paths so molecular biomarkers can fulfil those roles.

Genetic autophagy deficiency likewise produced abnormal mitochondria and reduced mitochondrial function, supporting a necessary role for autophagy in the biogenic response. The authors therefore conclude that mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis are tightly coupled during skeletal muscle adaptation to endurance exercise; Bnip3 (rather than PINK1/Parkin) is suggested as a candidate mitophagy mediator in this setting.\n\nKey supporting points:\n(ju_2016, ju_2016__abstract__000)\n- The endurance training\u2013induced increases in mitochondrial biogenesis markers (SDH, COX IV, PGC-1\u03b1) were abolished when autophagy/mitophagy was inhibited with colchicine. (ju_2016, ju_2016__abstract__000) (ju_2016, ju_2016__results__002)\n- Short-term inhibition of autophagy was sufficient to reverse/abolish the effects of 8 weeks of exercise training, indicating a rapid dependence of biogenesis on ongoing autophagy. (ju_2016, ju_2016__results__002)\n- Autophagy-deficient transgenic mice showed accumulated protein aggregates, abnormal mitochondria, and decreased mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle, consistent with autophagy being important for mitochondrial quality and for exercise-induced mitochondrial adaptations. (ju_2016, ju_2016__results__003)\n- The authors state that mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis are tightly coupled and that a coordinated balance between them is a prerequisite for mitochondrial adaptation to exercise. (ju_2016, ju_2016__results__003)\n- Bnip3 protein was increased in exercised muscle (with colchicine treatment) while PINK1/Parkin were unchanged, leading the authors to highlight Bnip3 as a possible mediator of exercise-induced mitophagy. (ju_2016, ju_2016__abstract__000) (ju_2016, ju_2016__results__001)\n\nOverall interpretation: The provided study provides multiple lines of in vivo mouse evidence (exercise-induced increase in autophagic flux; pharmacologic inhibition that abolishes biogenesis markers; and corroborating transgenic-model data) that autophagy/mitophagy is necessary for, and tightly linked to, exercise-induced mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle.

They emphasize distinguishing biomarkers of biological age versus biomarkers of the rate of aging (AgeDev and pace), the need for analytical and clinical validation, and caution about data-driven models that may mix causal and noncausal features (see citations). (cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__000; cell_2023, cell_2023__results__002; cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__001; cell_2023, cell_2023__results__001).\n\n- Furrer & Handschin (Physiol Rev 2025) provide a framework that stresses rigorous validation (including biological, cross-species, predictive, analytical, and clinical validation), strong standardization, and the central role of physiological (functional) biomarkers \u2014 arguing these should serve as benchmarks for molecular clocks and that multicomponent/systemic indices are currently most promising. They also caution that molecular clocks must be used with care until longitudinal validation is available (see citations). (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__008; furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__009; furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__010).\n\nWhere they agree\n- Need for a formal framework and validation pathway. Both works call for standardized frameworks and multiple validation steps (analytical and clinical) to move biomarkers toward clinical use (cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__000; furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__008).\n- Mechanistic/biological plausibility matters. Both emphasize that biomarkers should reflect underlying biology (not just correlates) and that mechanistic evidence strengthens a biomarker (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__002; furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__008).\n- Caution about data-driven molecular clocks and need for longitudinal validation. Moqri et al. warn that data-driven algorithms may mix causal and noncausal features, and Furrer & Handschin state molecular clocks must be used with caution pending validation in longitudinal human studies (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__001; furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__008).\n- Value of integrative/multisystem measures. Both recognize that composite or multisystem biomarkers can be more robust than single-feature measures (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__001; furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__008).\n\nWhere they differ (emphasis and recommendations)\n- Emphasis on physiological/functional biomarkers: Furrer & Handschin place physiological biomarkers (e.g., cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle mass/strength, frailty measures) at the center, stating they are \"ready for prime time\" and should benchmark molecular measures, and arguing multicomponent functional indices may currently be best for monitoring aging (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__010; furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__009; furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__008). Moqri et al. support including functional parameters in model training but present a broader regulatory/terminology framework rather than prioritizing physiologic measures as the primary benchmark (cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__002; cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__000).\n- Conceptual framing of age measurement: Moqri et al. articulate and formalize the distinction between biomarkers of the progress of aging (biological age / AgeDev) and biomarkers of the rate of aging (pace/speedometer), proposing AgeDev as terminology and recommending paired evaluation of both kinds of biomarkers (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__002; cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__002). Furrer & Handschin focus more on validation dimensions and on whether biomarkers reflect pathways that drive aging, with less explicit adoption of the AgeDev/pace terminology in the excerpts provided (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__008).\n- Cross-species and biological-driver validation emphasis: Furrer & Handschin explicitly list cross-species validation and whether biomarkers derive from pathways that actively drive aging as key criteria, and they argue these validations increase a biomarker\u2019s likelihood of reflecting fundamental aging processes (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__008). Moqri et al. also discuss mechanistic criteria and generalizability, including between species and tissues, but their excerpts place more explicit emphasis on regulatory use cases and surrogate endpoint validation pathways (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__002; cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__001).\n\nSynthesis / practical implication from the two frameworks\n- The two frameworks are complementary: Moqri et al. provide a regulatory/terminology structure and formal distinctions (AgeDev vs pace) useful for study design and surrogate-endpoint thinking, while Furrer & Handschin emphasize the immediate practical value of physiological, multicomponent biomarkers and rigorous multi-dimensional validation (including cross-species and biological-driver validation) as benchmarks for molecular approaches. Combining these perspectives suggests prioritizing robust physiological endpoints as anchors while pursuing mechanistically informed, well-validated molecular clocks that report both biological age and the pace of aging.\n", "citations": [{"source_id": "cell_2023", "chunk_id": "cell_2023__methods__000", "relevant_quote": "we propose a framework for classifying and assessing biomarkers of aging as tools to identify and evaluate longevity interventions"}, {"source_id": "cell_2023", "chunk_id": "cell_2023__results__002", "relevant_quote": "we propose the more informative and straightforward term \u2018\u2018age deviation\u2019\u2019 (AgeDev; Table 1)."}, {"source_id": "cell_2023", "chunk_id": "cell_2023__methods__001", "relevant_quote": "Validation of a biomarker as a surrogate endpoint requires clinical evidence that a change in the surrogate endpoint predicts a specific clinical benefit."}, {"source_id": "cell_2023", "chunk_id": "cell_2023__results__001", "relevant_quote": "data-driven approaches create new challenges in evaluating validity: in the absence of underlying biological or interpretable models, algorithms are likely to detect a mix of features that can cause aging or be caused by the aging process."}, {"source_id": "cell_2023", "chunk_id": "cell_2023__methods__002", "relevant_quote": "Biomarkers of the rate of aging relate to markers of biological age as speedometers (which measure speed in distance per time) relate to odometers (which measure total distance traveled)"}, {"source_id": "furrer_handschin_2025", "chunk_id": "furrer_handschin_2025__results__008", "relevant_quote": "First, biomarkers are especially valuable when they originate from pathways that actively drive aging (biological validation)"}, {"source_id": "furrer_handschin_2025", "chunk_id": "furrer_handschin_2025__results__008", "relevant_quote": "compound measures and indices that describe systemic, or at least multiorgan, health, relevant for resilience and functional retention, might have the highest chance to monitor aging progression"}, {"source_id": "furrer_handschin_2025", "chunk_id": "furrer_handschin_2025__results__009", "relevant_quote": "proven, physiological biomarkers of aging should be used to benchmark any new molecular biomarkers"}, {"source_id": "furrer_handschin_2025", "chunk_id": "furrer_handschin_2025__results__010", "relevant_quote": "PHYSIOLOGICAL BIOMARKERS OF AGING: READY FOR PRIME TIME!"}], "confidence": "high", "evidence_quality": "high", "no_evidence": false, "caveats": ["All claims are based only on the provided excerpts from the two papers; other sections of the full papers may add nuance not available here.", "I did not add external facts or figures beyond the quoted text."]}}

furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__006).\n\n- Population heterogeneity and socioeconomic/environmental confounding: lifelong socioeconomic factors (e.g., \"the childhood postcode\") and access disparities strongly influence outcomes and can confound interpretation (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__002).\n\n- Complexity of interventions and interactions with lifestyle: single pharmacological compounds are unlikely to match multifactorial lifestyle effects and can antagonize proven interventions such as exercise (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__004).\n\n- Safety gaps and absence of human efficacy data for some proposed therapies: several interventions (e.g., telomerase gene therapy) currently lack proof of benefit in humans and carry safety concerns (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__015).", "citations": [{"source_id": "furrer_handschin_2025", "chunk_id": "furrer_handschin_2025__abstract__000", "relevant_quote": "limited translatability of results obtained in model organisms, additionally confined by the need for extremely time-consuming clinical studies in the ostensible absence of robust bio- markers"}, {"source_id": "furrer_handschin_2025", "chunk_id": "furrer_handschin_2025__results__003", "relevant_quote": "Mechanisms, interventions, and pharmacological treatments that emerge from the study of these canonical model organisms might therefore not be directly extrapolatable to humans"}, {"source_id": "furrer_handschin_2025", "chunk_id": "furrer_handschin_2025__results__003", "relevant_quote": "Most canonical model organisms are bred, kept, and experimented on under strictly standardized conditions"}, {"source_id": "furrer_handschin_2025", "chunk_id": "furrer_handschin_2025__results__005", "relevant_quote": "Many of the problems that affect the study and potential treatment of human aging boil down to the long time frame that is needed based on human life expectancy"}, {"source_id": "furrer_handschin_2025", "chunk_id": "furrer_handschin_2025__results__005", "relevant_quote": "aging, a physiolog- ical (?) process experienced by every human, is not rec- ognized as a disease by regulatory agencies, at least at the moment"}, {"source_id": "furrer_handschin_2025", "chunk_id": "furrer_handschin_2025__results__006", "relevant_quote": "At the moment, no consensus on methodology and clock as standard biomarker for human aging has emerged"}, {"source_id": "furrer_handschin_2025", "chunk_id": "furrer_handschin_2025__results__006", "relevant_quote": "Most of these clocks, however, have only been tested in small cohorts and are marred by inherently large transcriptional noise"}, {"source_id": "furrer_handschin_2025", "chunk_id": "furrer_handschin_2025__results__006", "relevant_quote": "Significant deviations between technical replicates of the same samples can exist, in one study with median and maximal deviation of 3 yr and 8 yr, respectively"}, {"source_id": "furrer_handschin_2025", "chunk_id": "furrer_handschin_2025__results__006", "relevant_quote": "Plasma protein signature, however, can be affected by organ function, e.g., that of the kidney"}, {"source_id": "furrer_handschin_2025", "chunk_id": "furrer_handschin_2025__results__002", "relevant_quote": "the childhood postcode can, at least in certain countries like the United States, predict lifetime risks for many pathologies reasonably well"}, {"source_id": "furrer_handschin_2025", "chunk_id": "furrer_handschin_2025__results__002", "relevant_quote": "These data illustrate that even in countries where the highest-quality and cutting-edge medical care is available for those who can afford it, socioeconomic barriers and ethnic/racial disparities exist"}, {"source_id": "furrer_handschin_2025", "chunk_id": "furrer_handschin_2025__results__004", "relevant_quote": "First, it is unlikely that the benefits of single compounds exceed those elicited by the multifactorial adaptations in exercise"}, {"source_id": "furrer_handschin_2025", "chunk_id": "furrer_handschin_2025__results__015", "relevant_quote": "At the moment, there is no proof of efficacy of therapeutic benefits in humans"}], "confidence": "high", "evidence_quality": "moderate", "no_evidence": false, "caveats": ["All points are drawn from the single provided review (Furrer & Handschin 2025);

The study also reports that PINK1/Parkin protein levels were unchanged while Bnip3 was implicated in exercise-induced mitophagy, and that short-term inhibition of autophagy is sufficient to reverse the effects of 8 weeks of training, implying rapid mitochondrial turnover and transcriptional regulation (ju_2016, ju_2016__results__001; ju_2016, ju_2016__results__002).", "citations": [{"source_id": "ju_2016", "chunk_id": "ju_2016__abstract__000", "relevant_quote": "The autophagic flux assay demonstrated that swimming training resulted in an increase in the autophagic flux (*100 % increase in LC3-II) in mouse skeletal muscle."}, {"source_id": "ju_2016", "chunk_id": "ju_2016__results__002", "relevant_quote": "increased mitochondrial biogenesis markers were observed when autophagy was activated by exercise training, while exercise training-induced mitochondrial biogenesis was abolished when mitophagy was inhibited with colchicine treatment."}, {"source_id": "ju_2016", "chunk_id": "ju_2016__introduction__001", "relevant_quote": "mice with deficient/defective autophagy (e.g., Becn1?/-, Atg6?/-, and Atg7-/-) have been shown to result in an attenuation of exercise-induced metabolic benefits, decreased in mitochondrial function and exercise performance"}, {"source_id": "ju_2016", "chunk_id": "ju_2016__results__003", "relevant_quote": "the present study demonstrated that 8-week swimming exercise training increases the basal autophagy flux and expression of the autophagy/mitophagy-related genes in mouse skeletal muscle."}, {"source_id": "ju_2016", "chunk_id": "ju_2016__results__001", "relevant_quote": "The present study showed that the protein levels of PINK1 and Parkin were unchanged by exercise training as well as colchicine treatment."}, {"source_id": "ju_2016", "chunk_id": "ju_2016__results__002", "relevant_quote": "a short-term inhibition of autophagy is sufficient to reverse/abolish the effects of 8 weeks of exercise training and this effect is transcriptionally regulated."}], "confidence": "high", "evidence_quality": "Consistent in vivo mouse data from the same study showing (1) increased autophagic flux with endurance training, and (2) loss of exercise-induced mitochondrial biogenesis when autophagy/mitophagy was acutely inhibited.", "no_evidence": false, "caveats": ["Mechanistic details linking mitophagy to the transcriptional control of mitochondrial biogenesis are not fully defined in the provided text (ju_2016, ju_2016__introduction__001).", "The dependence on autophagy was shown using short-term pharmacological inhibition (colchicine) in trained mice; results may differ with other models or chronic genetic loss of autophagy (ju_2016, ju_2016__results__002).", "The study reports PINK1/Parkin were unchanged and highlights Bnip3 involvement, but regulatory kinases/phosphatases for Bnip3 are stated as not known in the text (ju_2016, ju_2016__results__001; ju_2016, ju_2016__results__002)."]}}

Summarized succinctly, the principal criteria are:\n\n- Age-sensitivity and outcome prediction: the biomarker should (1) correlate with multiple age-sensitive features after adjusting for chronological age and (2) be a good predictor of all-cause mortality (i.e., predict aging-associated outcomes) (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__001).\n\n- Responsiveness (response criteria): the biomarker should be responsive to both accelerated and decelerated aging and indicate biological reactions to interventions or exposures (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__003) (cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__003).\n\n- Mechanistic grounding: the biomarker should reflect underlying cellular and molecular processes (the \u2018\u2018hallmarks/pillars\u2019\u2019 of aging) so it links to biology rather than only statistical correlates (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__002).\n\n- Generalizability: the biomarker should function across relevant settings (tissues, species, and human populations) or at least the limits of its applicability should be understood (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__002).\n\n- Integrative/multisystem performance: composite, multisystem biomarkers are preferred because they are more robust and better correlate with other aging features than single measures (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__001).\n\n- Distinction of progress versus pace: evaluators should distinguish biomarkers that estimate the progress of aging (biological age / AgeDev) from those that measure the pace or rate of aging (speedometer vs. odometer roles); both can be complementary (cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__002) (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__002).\n\n- Clinical validation / surrogate endpoint evidence: for use as surrogate endpoints, biomarker changes must be linked to demonstrable clinical benefits in humans (cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__001).\n\n- Practical considerations: appropriate sample/tissue choice and feasibility (including measurement cost) are important for real-world application and scalability (cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__002) (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__004).", "citations": [{"source_id": "cell_2023", "chunk_id": "cell_2023__results__001", "relevant_quote": "a biomarker of aging should (1) correlate with multiple age-sensitive features after adjusting for chronological age and (2) be a good predictor of all-cause mortality."}, {"source_id": "cell_2023", "chunk_id": "cell_2023__results__003", "relevant_quote": "Response criteria Generally, response criteria posit that a biomarker of aging should be responsive to both accelerated and decelerated aging."}, {"source_id": "cell_2023", "chunk_id": "cell_2023__methods__003", "relevant_quote": "A response biomarker indicates the biological reaction of an individual to an exposure or intervention."}, {"source_id": "cell_2023", "chunk_id": "cell_2023__results__002", "relevant_quote": "a valid biomarker of aging should reflect these underlying cellular and molecular processes."}, {"source_id": "cell_2023", "chunk_id": "cell_2023__results__002", "relevant_quote": "Generalizability broadly refers to the ability of biomarkers to function across different applications."}, {"source_id": "cell_2023", "chunk_id": "cell_2023__results__001", "relevant_quote": "composite multisystem biomarkers are more robust and show a stronger correlation with other features of aging than single biomarkers of aging."}, {"source_id": "cell_2023", "chunk_id": "cell_2023__methods__002", "relevant_quote": "An important conceptual distinction needs to be made between biomarkers of biological age and biomarkers of the rate of aging."}, {"source_id": "cell_2023", "chunk_id": "cell_2023__methods__001", "relevant_quote": "Validation of a biomarker as a surrogate endpoint requires clinical evidence that a change in the surrogate endpoint predicts a specific clinical benefit."}, {"source_id": "cell_2023", "chunk_id": "cell_2023__methods__002", "relevant_quote": "the biological sample used for measuring aging is critical."}, {"source_id": "cell_2023", "chunk_id": "cell_2023__results__004", "relevant_quote": "To implement biomarkers of aging in large-scale settings... the cost of measurement must be relatively low."}], "confidence": "high", "evidence_quality": "high", "no_evidence": false, "caveats": ["These criteria are synthesized from the review\u2019s discussion of validity, mechanistic grounding, generalizability, and practical considerations and reflect the review\u2019s recommended framework rather than a single numbered checklist."]}}

All three approaches converge on nutrient\u2011sensing pathways (mTOR/TOR, insulin/IGF signaling, AMPK) but differ in how they engage them and in the strength of longevity evidence across organisms and humans.\n\nMechanisms \u2014 caloric restriction (CR): CR down\u2011regulates insulin/IGF and TOR pathways and activates energy sensors that inhibit mTOR and promote cellular cleanup (autophagy). CR \u201cactivates AMP\u2011activated protein kinase (AMPK) \u2026 which then inhibits mTORC1\u201d and CR involves \u201cdown\u2011regulation of insulin and insulin\u2011like signalling (IIS), as well as of the amino signalling target of rapamycin (TOR)\u201d.

A controlled trial (CALERIE) found that two years of 25% CR is feasible and yields health benefits such as reduced inflammatory markers and cardiometabolic risk factors, though CR was associated with reduced bone mineral density.

They differ in emphasis: Moqri et al. (Cell 2023) formalize concepts like AgeDev and the odometer vs speedometer distinction and stress multisystem, cross-species, and mechanistic criteria; Furrer & Handschin (Physiol Rev 2025) place stronger emphasis on the current limitations of molecular \"clocks,\" the readiness and central role of physiological/functional biomarkers, and pragmatic considerations (feasibility, invasiveness, cost) for benchmarking molecular measures.\n\nAgreements\n- Both present a formal framework for classifying and assessing biomarkers of aging (e.g., predictive/prognostic/response uses) and call for standardized evaluation (Cell; Physiol Rev) (cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__000) (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__008).\n- Both require mechanistic grounding and cross-context generalizability (mechanistic criteria, validation across species/populations) (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__002) (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__008).\n- Both caution that molecular clocks can be affected by technical, preanalytical, or physiological confounders and therefore need longitudinal and standardized validation (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__001) (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__007).\n- Both endorse composite/multisystem approaches as more robust than single measures (Cell emphasizes integrative biomarkers; Physiol Rev highlights combining proteome/metabolome and benchmarking against physiological measures) (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__001) (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__009).\n\nKey differences / emphases\n- Conceptual framing: Moqri et al. formalize AgeDev and explicitly distinguish biomarkers of the progress of aging (biological age / \"odometer\") from biomarkers of the rate of aging (\"speedometer\") as complementary concepts (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__002).  Furrer & Handschin do not foreground that specific odometer/speedometer terminology in the provided excerpts but focus on broader assessment/validation dimensions (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__008).\n- Physiological vs molecular priority: Furrer & Handschin argue physiological/functional biomarkers (cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle mass/strength, frailty) are \"ready for prime time,\" underappreciated, and should be used to benchmark molecular biomarkers; they stress practical criteria (feasibility, invasiveness, cost) (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__010) (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__009). Moqri et al. strongly promote multisystem/composite molecular and omic biomarkers and cross-species translatability but give more conceptual detail about how to evaluate biomarker types (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__001) (cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__000).\n- Practical cautions and current state: Furrer & Handschin explicitly emphasize current technical and context limitations of molecular clocks (circadian effects, tissue differences) and urge caution until longitudinal validation in large cohorts is available (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__007) (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__008). Moqri et al. likewise note challenges of data-driven models (risk of picking correlates or study-specific features) and call for mechanistic interpretability, but they frame these within a broader methodological and regulatory classification effort (cell_2023, cell_2023__results__001) (cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__000).\n\nNet takeaway: The two frameworks are complementary. Moqri et al. provide a conceptual and methodological taxonomy (including AgeDev and pace vs progress distinctions) and stress mechanistic and cross-species criteria; Furrer & Handschin apply a pragmatic lens that elevates physiological/functional measures as immediate benchmarks while documenting concrete technical pitfalls and validation needs for molecular clocks.

First, exercise activates canonical mitochondrial biogenesis programs centered on PGC-1\u03b1 (PGC-1 alpha is repeatedly identified as a nodal regulator and exercise stimulates its transcription), with p38 MAPK implicated as an upstream activator of PGC-1\u03b1 (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__024; mol_bio_rep_2025, mol_bio_rep_2025__abstract__010). Second, cellular energy sensing via AMPK\u2014including a mitochondria-localized AMPK pool\u2014links energetic stress to mitophagy and mitochondrial quality control (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__024). Third, autophagy/mitophagy pathways are repeatedly reported as essential for exercise-induced mitochondrial remodeling and functional adaptation (exercise reestablishes autophagic flux and mitochondrial quality control; autophagy is required for exercise training\u2013induced skeletal muscle adaptation), with Parkin-mediated mitophagy implicated in exercise cardioprotection (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__025; biology_2019, biology_2019__body__032; cells_2022, cells_2022__body__026). Fourth, studies emphasize mitochondrial proteostasis and turnover as a target of endurance training: exercise produces distinct remodeling of mitochondrial proteostasis markers and enhancement of mitochondrial protein turnover via mitophagy can produce hypertrophy in aged muscle (s2468867319, s2468867319_2019__introduction__004; s2468867319, s2468867319_2019__introduction__003). Fifth, exercise upregulates antioxidant and redox-related responses (for example, resistance exercise decreases oxidative DNA damage and increases cytochrome oxidase activity; mitochondrial quality correlates with aerobic fitness) that accompany mitochondrial functional improvements (biology_2019, biology_2019__body__031; biology_2019, biology_2019__body__030). Finally, transcriptional regulators tied to lysosomal/autophagic control (TFEB) are induced by exercise in a PGC-1\u03b1\u2013dependent manner, linking biogenesis and degradation pathways (biology_2019, biology_2019__body__032).\n\nTaken together, the corpus frames exercise-induced mitochondrial adaptation as an integrated program: upstream signaling (p38 MAPK, AMPK) activates biogenesis (PGC-1\u03b1) while concurrently engaging quality-control pathways (autophagy/mitophagy, Parkin) and proteostatic and antioxidant responses, producing improvements in mitochondrial quantity and quality with exercise training (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__024; cells_2022, cells_2022__body__025; biology_2019, biology_2019__body__030).", "citations": [{"source_id": "cells_2022", "chunk_id": "cells_2022__body__024", "relevant_quote": "Exercise stimulates Pgc-1alpha transcription in skeletal muscle through activation of the p38 MAPK pathway."}, {"source_id": "mol_bio_rep_2025", "chunk_id": "mol_bio_rep_2025__abstract__010", "relevant_quote": "Regulation of PGC-1\u03b1, a nodal regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis."}, {"source_id": "cells_2022", "chunk_id": "cells_2022__body__024", "relevant_quote": "Mitochondria-localized AMPK responds to local energetics and contributes to exercise and energetic stress-induced mitophagy."}, {"source_id": "cells_2022", "chunk_id": "cells_2022__body__025", "relevant_quote": "Exercise reestablishes autophagic flux and mitochondrial quality control in heart failure."}, {"source_id": "biology_2019", "chunk_id": "biology_2019__body__032", "relevant_quote": "Autophagy is required for exercise training-induced skeletal muscle adaptation and improvement of physical performance."}, {"source_id": "cells_2022", "chunk_id": "cells_2022__body__026", "relevant_quote": "Parkin Mediates Mitophagy to Participate in Cardioprotection Induced by Late Exercise Preconditioning but Bnip3 Does Not."}, {"source_id": "s2468867319_2019", "chunk_id": "s2468867319_2019__introduction__004", "relevant_quote": "There were distinct patterns in markers of mitochondria proteostasis that indicated remodeling of mitochondria during the four months of a new exercise training program"}, {"source_id": "s2468867319_2019", "chunk_id": "s2468867319_2019__introduction__003", "relevant_quote": "Enhancement of mitochondrial protein turnover by upregulation of mitophagy produces muscle hypertrophy in aged mice"}, {"source_id": "biology_2019", "chunk_id": "biology_2019__body__031", "relevant_quote": "Resistance exercise training decreases oxidative damage to DNA and increases cytochrome oxidase activity in older adults."}, {"source_id": "biology_2019", "chunk_id": "biology_2019__body__030", "relevant_quote": "Mitochondria express enhanced quality as well as quantity in association with aerobic fitness across recreationally active individuals up to elite athletes."}, {"source_id": "biology_2019", "chunk_id": "biology_2019__body__032", "relevant_quote": "Exercise induces TFEB expression and activity in skeletal muscle in a PGC-1\u03b1-dependent manner."}], "confidence": "high", "evidence_quality": "Multiple review articles and empirical studies in the corpus consistently report overlapping signaling nodes (PGC-1\u03b1, AMPK, p38 MAPK), quality-control mechanisms (autophagy/mitophagy, Parkin), proteostasis remodeling, and antioxidant responses.", "no_evidence": false, "caveats": ["The corpus notes that the impact of long-term endurance exercise on proteostatic mechanisms is underexplored (s2468867319, s2468867319_2019__introduction__004).", "Authors caution that acute snapshots of responses can be misleading for assessing chronic adaptations, implying differences across time courses and study designs (s2468867319, s2468867319_2019__introduction__004)."]}}

The Lancet (Koemel et al.) analysis similarly finds that modest joint gains (for example +5 min sleep, +1.9 min MVPA, +5 DQS) are associated with about one additional year of lifespan and that optimal SPAN combinations can be linked to up to nearly a decade of additional lifespan/healthspan.

furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__006).\n\n- Tissue heterogeneity and sampling effects (including circadian timing): age\u2011dependent measures differ between organs, cell types, spatial locations, and time of sampling (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__007).\n\n- Environmental and laboratory artifacts and socioeconomic confounders: standardized lab conditions and human socioeconomic/environmental differences can introduce artifacts or dominate effects on health outcomes (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__003;

(cell_2023, cell_2023__methods__000) (cell_2023, cell_2023__conclusion__000)\n  In contrast, Furrer & Handschin (Physiol Rev 2025) provide a more critical, method\u2011level appraisal of specific molecular clocks (epigenetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic), documenting technical limitations, tissue heterogeneity, circadian and perturbation effects, and variability between clocks and replicates.

(See citations below.)\n\n- Intermittent fasting (IF): IF\u2019s cyclic fasting/feeding pattern engages overlapping pathways with CR but via periodic metabolic stress; it can improve insulin sensitivity and more strongly induce cellular stress-response pathways (for example, heat shock proteins and sirtuins) compared with continuous CR (nutrients_2024, nutrients_2024__results__001; f1000_2016, f1000_2016__introduction__002).\n\n\nEvidence for longevity/healthspan benefits\n\n- Strong and reproducible in model organisms for CR: CR is described as \u201cthe most effective and reproducible dietary intervention\u201d for extending healthy lifespan across organisms (f1000_2016, f1000_2016__abstract__000). CR and related interventions act through conserved pathways (IIS, TOR) that mediate lifespan effects (f1000_2016, f1000_2016__introduction__000).\n\n- IF / periodic fasting in models: Intermittent and periodic fasting have been reported to increase lifespan in experimental systems, in some cases even without an overall reduction in calorie intake (f1000_2016, f1000_2016__introduction__002).\n\n- Humans: Clinical data show CR can produce measurable health benefits (for example, the CALERIE trial found a two\u2011year 25% CR feasible with health improvements), but there is currently no clear evidence that bona fide CR extends human lifespan; responses also vary by genetics and sex (f1000_2016, f1000_2016__introduction__001; furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__014).\n\nKey caveats\n\n- Most longevity evidence is from model organisms; translation to human lifespan remains unproven (f1000_2016, f1000_2016__abstract__000; furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__014).", "citations": [{"source_id": "nutrients_2024", "chunk_id": "nutrients_2024__results__001", "relevant_quote": "CR also activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) due to lower ATP levels"}, {"source_id": "nutrients_2024", "chunk_id": "nutrients_2024__results__001", "relevant_quote": "mTORC1 inhibition under CR conditions promotes autophagy"}, {"source_id": "nutrients_2024", "chunk_id": "nutrients_2024__results__001", "relevant_quote": "IF\u2019s cyclic fasting and feeding peri- ods may lead to more pronounced improvements in insulin sensitivity"}, {"source_id": "nutrients_2024", "chunk_id": "nutrients_2024__results__002", "relevant_quote": "It highlights the contrast between high-energy and low-energy states and their respective influences on critical signaling pathways like mTORC1, AMPK, and insulin signaling"}, {"source_id": "f1000_2016", "chunk_id": "f1000_2016__abstract__000", "relevant_quote": "Caloric restriction is the most effective and reproducible dietary intervention known to regulate aging and increase the healthy lifespan in various model organisms"}, {"source_id": "f1000_2016", "chunk_id": "f1000_2016__introduction__002", "relevant_quote": "Both intermittent and periodic fasting can increase lifespan, even when there is little or no overall decrease in calorie intake"}, {"source_id": "f1000_2016", "chunk_id": "f1000_2016__introduction__000", "relevant_quote": "down-regulation of insulin and insulin-like signalling (IIS), as well as of the amino signalling target of rapamycin (TOR)-S6 kinase pathway"}, {"source_id": "f1000_2016", "chunk_id": "f1000_2016__introduction__001", "relevant_quote": "a two year 25% caloric restriction is feasible for humans and provides health benefits"}, {"source_id": "f1000_2016", "chunk_id": "f1000_2016__conclusion__000", "relevant_quote": "can be achieved by periodic interventions which do not require an overall reduction in calorie intake"}, {"source_id": "furrer_handschin_2025", "chunk_id": "furrer_handschin_2025__results__014", "relevant_quote": "hereditability had a larger effect on lifespan compared to die- tary restriction"}, {"source_id": "furrer_handschin_2025", "chunk_id": "furrer_handschin_2025__results__014", "relevant_quote": "no clear evidence of lon- gevity benefits of bona fide caloric restriction in humans currently exists"}, {"source_id": "furrer_handschin_2025", "chunk_id": "furrer_handschin_2025__results__014", "relevant_quote": "dietary restriction was associated with suboptimal health, e.g., loss of lean mass, compromised immune system func- tion"}], "confidence": "medium", "evidence_quality": "Strong in model organisms; limited/heterogeneous in humans (clinical metabolic benefits but no clear human lifespan extension)", "no_evidence": false, "caveats": ["Most longevity claims are from non-human models; human lifespan effects are not established (furrer_handschin_2025__results__014).", "Responses depend on genetics, sex, diet composition, and timing; adverse effects (loss of lean mass, immune impairment) have been reported in some contexts (furrer_handschin_2025__results__014).", "IF and FMD can reproduce many mechanistic effects of CR, but protocols and long-term human outcomes vary across studies (f1000_2016__conclusion__000; nutrients_2024__results__002).", "Entity guard: removed 3 sentence(s) containing terms not found in context: ['DR/CR', 'FMD', 'IIS/TOR']"]}}

Examples from the corpus: AMPK \u2014 mitochondria-localized AMPK responds to local energetics and contributes to exercise- and energetic stress-induced mitophagy (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__024) and AMPK shows graded activation during exercise (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__023). PGC-1\u03b1/biogenesis \u2014 exercise stimulates Pgc-1alpha transcription in skeletal muscle (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__024) and PGC-1\u03b1 is described as a nodal regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis (mol_bio_rep_2025, mol_bio_rep_2025__abstract__010). Mitophagy/quality control \u2014 exercise \"reestablishes autophagic flux and mitochondrial quality control\" in heart failure (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__025) and upregulation of mitophagy enhances mitochondrial protein turnover and can drive muscle hypertrophy in aged mice (s2468867319_2019, s2468867319_2019__introduction__003). Parkin is specifically implicated in exercise-linked cardioprotective mitophagy (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__026). Mitochondrial dynamics \u2014 exercise produces \"distinct patterns of skeletal muscle mitochondria fusion, fission and mitophagy\" depending on training duration (cells_2022, cells_2022__body__025). Respiratory chain / supercomplexes \u2014 moderate aerobic training \"increased the abundance of individual mitochondrial complexes and promoted mitochondrial supercomplex formation\" (s2468867319_2019, s2468867319_2019__introduction__003). Proteostasis and antioxidant defenses \u2014 exercise-related interventions alter mitochondrial proteostasis markers and protein turnover (s2468867319_2019, s2468867319_2019__introduction__004) and resistance exercise or acute exercise increase antioxidant-related activities/enzymes such as cytochrome oxidase activity and extracellular superoxide dismutase (biology_2019, biology_2019__body__031; cells_2022, cells_2022__body__026).", "citations": [{"source_id": "cells_2022", "chunk_id": "cells_2022__body__024", "relevant_quote": "Mitochondria-localized AMPK responds to local energetics and contributes to exercise and energetic stress-induced mitophagy."}, {"source_id": "cells_2022", "chunk_id": "cells_2022__body__023", "relevant_quote": "Physiological role of AMP-activated protein kinase in the heart: Graded activation during exercise."}, {"source_id": "cells_2022", "chunk_id": "cells_2022__body__024", "relevant_quote": "Exercise stimulates Pgc-1alpha transcription in skeletal muscle through activation of the p38 MAPK pathway."}, {"source_id": "mol_bio_rep_2025", "chunk_id": "mol_bio_rep_2025__abstract__010", "relevant_quote": "Regulation of PGC-1\u03b1, a nodal regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis."}, {"source_id": "cells_2022", "chunk_id": "cells_2022__body__025", "relevant_quote": "Exercise reestablishes autophagic flux and mitochondrial quality control in heart failure."}, {"source_id": "s2468867319_2019", "chunk_id": "s2468867319_2019__introduction__003", "relevant_quote": "Enhancement of mitochondrial protein turnover by upregulation of mitophagy produces muscle hypertrophy in aged mice"}, {"source_id": "cells_2022", "chunk_id": "cells_2022__body__026", "relevant_quote": "Parkin Mediates Mitophagy to Participate in Cardioprotection Induced by Late Exercise Preconditioning but Bnip3 Does Not."}, {"source_id": "cells_2022", "chunk_id": "cells_2022__body__025", "relevant_quote": "Distinct patterns of skeletal muscle mitochondria fusion, fission and mitophagy upon duration of exercise training."}, {"source_id": "s2468867319_2019", "chunk_id": "s2468867319_2019__introduction__003", "relevant_quote": "16 weeks of moderate intensity aerobic exercise increased the abundance of individual mitochondrial complexes and promoted mitochondrial supercomplex formation"}, {"source_id": "biology_2019", "chunk_id": "biology_2019__body__031", "relevant_quote": "Resistance exercise training decreases oxidative damage to DNA and increases cytochrome oxidase activity in older adults."}, {"source_id": "cells_2022", "chunk_id": "cells_2022__body__026", "relevant_quote": "Acute exercise increases expression of extracellular superoxide dismutase in skeletal muscle and the aorta."}, {"source_id": "s2468867319_2019", "chunk_id": "s2468867319_2019__introduction__004", "relevant_quote": "there is heterogeneity of age-related outcomes dependent on the muscle group studied"}, {"source_id": "s2468867319_2019", "chunk_id": "s2468867319_2019__introduction__005", "relevant_quote": "Mitochondrial respiratory flux declined with age, and lifelong wheel running access delayed this decline until 18 months"}], "confidence": "high", "evidence_quality": "Consistent multi-source support across reviews and primary studies in the provided corpus.", "no_evidence": false, "caveats": ["Responses are muscle-group- and age-dependent; markers and functional outcomes differ by muscle and by timing/duration of training (s2468867319_2019, s2468867319_2019__introduction__004).", "Short-term remodeling during initiation of training can show different marker patterns than long-term endurance training, and age/timepoint selection affects observed preservation of function (s2468867319_2019, s2468867319_2019__introduction__003; s2468867319_2019, s2468867319_2019__introduction__005)."]}}

from model organisms to humans, driven by differences in lifespan, physiology, and laboratory conditions (e.g., housing, temperature, pathogen status) that can introduce artifacts and limit extrapolation (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__003). \n\n- The very long human lifespan, which makes prospective, longitudinal clinical trials time-consuming, costly, and logistically challenging (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__005; furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__abstract__000). \n\n- Lack of robust, validated molecular biomarkers (clocks): no consensus on methodology or a standard clock, unclear physiological relevance, and poor predictive value for morbidity/mortality for many proposed markers (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__006). \n\n- Small cohort sizes, high measurement noise (especially transcriptomic noise), technical variability, and cost or coverage limitations for omics methods (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__006). \n\n- Methodological variability in specific assays (e.g., telomere length) across individuals, tissues, and sampling sites (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__006). \n\n- Poor recordkeeping and potential data quality issues in observational longevity datasets (for example, contested \u201cBlue Zone\u201d records), which complicate epidemiological inferences (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__001). \n\n- Ethical and regulatory constraints because aging is not currently classified as a disease, meaning interventions must be tested in healthy individuals under strict standards (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__005). \n\n- Incomplete mechanistic understanding of molecular signals (for example, why DNA methylation changes correlate with age), limiting interpretation of biomarker changes beyond correlative associations (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__001). \n\n- Potential interactions and confounding between proposed pharmacological geroprotective interventions and proven lifestyle interventions (e.g., exercise), which can obscure benefits or cause adverse effects (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__004).\n\nThese limitations are repeatedly emphasized in the review and collectively explain

Across model organisms CR is described as extending healthspan and/or lifespan, though results are mixed in primates and CR can have adverse health effects in humans.\n\nEvidence and nuances from the context:\n- The review states that CR \"is the most effective and reproducible dietary intervention known to regulate aging and increase the healthy lifespan in various model organisms\" (f1000_2016, f1000_2016__abstract__000). (f1000_2016, f1000_2016__abstract__000)\n- The same source also notes that \"Caloric restriction... is a severe intervention that results in both beneficial and detrimental effects,\" indicating CR can have adverse consequences even while generally beneficial for lifespan (f1000_2016, f1000_2016__abstract__000). (f1000_2016, f1000_2016__abstract__000)\n- In primates the findings are mixed: \"The NIA reported no improvement in lifespan but observed a positive trend for the delay of age-related diseases,\" while \"WNPRC reported significant improvement in both lifespan and healthspan,\" showing studies differ in outcomes for longevity in rhesus monkeys (f1000_2016, f1000_2016__introduction__001). (f1000_2016, f1000_2016__introduction__001)\n- In humans, the CALERIE trial found that a two-year 25% CR was feasible and produced health benefits, but also reported that \"caloric restriction was associated with reduced bone mineral density and exercise was recommended to offset such adverse effects\" (f1000_2016, f1000_2016__introduction__001). (f1000_2016, f1000_2016__introduction__001)\n- Genetic background can alter the response to CR: \"The long-lived GH receptor knock-out (GHRKO) mice... do not exhibit further lifespan extension or health benefits by caloric restriction... but the long-lived GH-deficient Ames mice do,\" indicating CR does not universally extend lifespan across genotypes (f1000_2016, f1000_2016__introduction__001). (f1000_2016, f1000_2016__introduction__001)\n\nOverall interpretation based on the provided context: the literature cited here does not report CR causing shorter lifespan; rather, CR generally extends lifespan in many models, but effects can vary by species, study, and genotype, and CR can produce adverse health effects (for example reduced bone mineral density in humans).", "citations": [{"source_id": "f1000_2016", "chunk_id": "f1000_2016__abstract__000", "relevant_quote": "Caloric restriction is the most effective and reproducible dietary intervention known to regulate aging and increase the healthy lifespan in various model organisms"}, {"source_id": "f1000_2016", "chunk_id": "f1000_2016__abstract__000", "relevant_quote": "Caloric restriction... is a severe intervention that results in both beneficial and detrimental effects"}, {"source_id": "f1000_2016", "chunk_id": "f1000_2016__introduction__001", "relevant_quote": "The NIA reported no improvement in lifespan but observed a positive trend for the delay of age-related diseases"}, {"source_id": "f1000_2016", "chunk_id": "f1000_2016__introduction__001", "relevant_quote": "whereas WNPRC reported significant improvement in both lifespan and healthspan"}, {"source_id": "f1000_2016", "chunk_id": "f1000_2016__introduction__001", "relevant_quote": "CALERIE... reported that a two year 25% caloric restriction is feasible for humans and provides health benefits...
