| 1 | CR lowers amino‑acid and insulin/IGF signals and activates AMPK , which together inhibit mTORC1 and promote autophagy | CR also activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) due to lower ATP levels, which then inhibits mTORC1 directly by phosphorylating Raptor and indirectly by activating the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1/2) | (nutrients_2024, nutrients_2024__results__000) | medium | Human evidence is mixed and limited; CR’s longevity benefit in humans is not clearly demonstrated (furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__014).; Trial heterogeneity (designs, populations, protocols) limits generalizability (nutrients_2024, nutrients_2024__results__002).; CR has feasible benefits but may have adverse effects (reduced bone mineral density) and variable effects by sex, genotype, and baseline diet (f1000_2016, f1000_2016__introduction__001; furrer_handschin_2025, furrer_handschin_2025__results__014).; Entity guard: removed 7 sentence(s) containing terms not found in context: ['AMPK/', 'FMD', 'IF/', 'IF/FMD', 'IIS/'] |
