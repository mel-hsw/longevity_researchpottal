| 1 | Brandhorst et al. used a clinical-chemistry based composite biological-age estimator composed of seven markers: albumin, alkaline phosphatase, serum creatinine, C-reactive protein , HbA1c, systolic blood pressure, and total cholesterol | here: albumin, alkaline phospha- tase, serum creatinine, C-reactive protein, Hba1c, systolic blood pres- sure, and total cholesterol | (brandhorst_2024, brandhorst_2024__results__006) | high | The study used these seven clinical markers combined into a single biological-age estimate; the context shows several of the individual markers (albumin, CRP, systolic blood pressure, HbA1c) had the strongest associations with the measured change. |
| 2 | Changes in biological age were associated particularly with changes in albumin, CRP, systolic blood pressure, and HbA1c | albumin (bicor = 0.37, p = 0.007), CRP (bicor = 0.63, p < 0.0001), systolic blood pressure (bicor = 0.64, p < 0.0001), and Hba1c (bicor = 0.35, p = 0.011) | (brandhorst_2024, brandhorst_2024__results__009) | high | The study used these seven clinical markers combined into a single biological-age estimate; the context shows several of the individual markers (albumin, CRP, systolic blood pressure, HbA1c) had the strongest associations with the measured change. |
