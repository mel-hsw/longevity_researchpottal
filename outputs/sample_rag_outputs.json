(f1000_2016, f1000_2016__abstract__000)\n- The same source also notes that \"Caloric restriction... is a severe intervention that results in both beneficial and detrimental effects,\" indicating CR can have adverse consequences even while generally beneficial for lifespan (f1000_2016, f1000_2016__abstract__000). (f1000_2016, f1000_2016__abstract__000)\n- In primates the findings are mixed: \"The NIA reported no improvement in lifespan but observed a positive trend for the delay of age-related diseases,\" while \"WNPRC reported significant improvement in both lifespan and healthspan,\" showing studies differ in outcomes for longevity in rhesus monkeys (f1000_2016, f1000_2016__introduction__001).

(f1000_2016, f1000_2016__introduction__001)\n- Genetic background can alter the response to CR: \"The long-lived GH receptor knock-out (GHRKO) mice... do not exhibit further lifespan extension or health benefits by caloric restriction... but the long-lived GH-deficient Ames mice do,\" indicating CR does not universally extend lifespan across genotypes (f1000_2016, f1000_2016__introduction__001).
